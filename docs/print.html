<p>This is an early preview version of Narrono RPG to solicit feedback. While most of the game structure and mechanics have received a lot of time and attention, formatting of materials, particularly those intended for printing is generally at the most rudimentary level at this point, making the files largely placeholders.</p>

<h2 id="artificial-intelligence"><a class="header" href="#artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a></h2>
<p>Because people often want to know whether AI was involved in the production of the things they use or consume, know that AI was involved in the design and production of this game. If that means it's not for you, that's fine. Feel free to move along to something else.</p>
<p>The reality is that I've had the idea for this game for YEARS and it would not have ever become more than an idea without AI tools to assist. It either exists with AI involvement or it doesn't exist at all. That's not a threat, it's probability and acknowledging my own reality.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Narrono, a tabletop roleplaying game where you and your friends collaboratively build a dramatic story that unfolds through play. In this game, your choices—both before the game begins and during each moment of play—shape the narrative in profound and exciting ways.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-narrono"><a class="header" href="#what-is-narrono">What is Narrono?</a></h2>
<p>At its heart, Narrono is a game about collaborative storytelling. Players and Game Facilitator work together to create compelling narratives where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You shape the story</strong> through meaningful choices that have lasting impact</li>
<li><strong>Your creative vision matters</strong> as much as the Game Facilitator's</li>
<li><strong>The narrative belongs to everyone</strong> at the table</li>
<li><strong>Drama emerges organically</strong> from character choices and their consequences</li>
<li><strong>The mechanics serve the story</strong>, not the other way around</li>
</ul>
<p>Narrono is a medium-complexity roleplaying system designed to create stories where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every action and choice creates rippling consequences throughout the narrative</li>
<li>Settings are defined by clear choices that shape the world and its possibilities</li>
<li>Characters emerge from and influence their settings</li>
<li>Characters are defined by narrative elements that both enable and complicate their actions</li>
<li>Assets can be risked for greater effect, creating story opportunities</li>
<li>Relationships bind characters together in setting-appropriate ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you're exploring a tribal society with limited technology and direct conflicts, or navigating a fluid social structure with fantastic technology and ideological struggles, Narrono provides the framework for meaningful character choices and evolving narratives where your decisions truly matter.</p>
<h3 id="a-game-of-collaborative-storytelling"><a class="header" href="#a-game-of-collaborative-storytelling">A Game of Collaborative Storytelling</a></h3>
<p>In Narrono, the story isn't predetermined—it's created moment by moment through the choices you make. The Game Facilitator presents situations and challenges, but how those situations unfold depends entirely on what your characters choose to do and how they choose to do it.</p>
<p>Your choices begin even before play starts. During setting creation, you'll help determine what kind of world your story takes place in. During character creation, you'll define who your character is and how they connect to that world. And during play, every decision you make—from which traits to emphasize to which relationships to risk—shapes the unfolding narrative in ways neither you nor the Game Facilitator could have predicted.</p>
<p>This collaborative approach means that everyone at the table has genuine ownership of the story. The Game Facilitator may guide the overall direction, but the specific path, the emotional beats, and the ultimate resolution emerge from the collective creativity of the entire group.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts"><a class="header" href="#core-concepts">Core Concepts</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the rules, here are the key concepts that make Narrono unique:</p>
<h3 id="the-five-axes"><a class="header" href="#the-five-axes">The Five Axes</a></h3>
<p>Every setting in Narrono is defined by five axes, each representing a fundamental aspect of the world:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Scale:</strong> From Personal to Global</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural Level:</strong> From None to Dominant</li>
<li><strong>Technology Level:</strong> From Limited to Fantastic</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure:</strong> From Tribal to Fluid</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Type:</strong> From Direct to Ideological</li>
</ul>
<p>These axes don't just describe your setting—they actively shape what characters can do, what assets are available, and how relationships function.</p>
<h3 id="character-traits"><a class="header" href="#character-traits">Character Traits</a></h3>
<p>Characters in Narrono are defined by three core traits that emerge directly from the setting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Shaped by the Social Structure</li>
<li><strong>Drive:</strong> Shaped by the Conflict Type</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Shaped by the Power Scale</li>
</ul>
<p>Each trait not only tells you who your character is but also creates bonds, complications, and weaknesses that drive the story forward.</p>
<h3 id="the-pool-system"><a class="header" href="#the-pool-system">The Pool System</a></h3>
<p>Actions in Narrono are resolved using the Pool System—a flexible dice mechanic that balances narrative possibility with strategic choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll three six-sided dice (3d6)</li>
<li>Choose which die to use based on your method (Direct, Balanced, or Cautious)</li>
<li>Interpret the result as Success, Partial Success, or Setback</li>
<li>Narrate the outcome and its consequences</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assets-and-relationships"><a class="header" href="#assets-and-relationships">Assets and Relationships</a></h3>
<p>Your character's equipment, abilities, and connections are represented by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assets:</strong> Resources that can be used and risked</li>
<li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Connections to other characters that provide support and complications</li>
</ul>
<p>Both assets and relationships exist in multiple states (Fresh/Strong, Degraded/Strained, Depleted/Broken) that reflect their condition and availability.</p>
<h3 id="the-shared-story-pool"><a class="header" href="#the-shared-story-pool">The Shared Story Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Shared Story Pool represents the group's collective influence on the narrative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player contributes dice to a shared pool</li>
<li>Players can take dice to add complexity, establish relationships, create opportunities, or enhance rolls</li>
<li>This allows everyone to contribute to the story, even when their characters aren't directly involved</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</a></h2>
<p>This manual is organized to guide you through learning and playing Narrono:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chapter 1: Core Rules</strong> introduces the Pool System and Relationship Web</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 2: Setting Creation</strong> explains how to use the Five Axes to build your world</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 3: Character Creation</strong> shows how to develop characters connected to the setting</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 4: Detailed Mechanics</strong> explores advanced options and special circumstances</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 5: Game Facilitation</strong> provides guidance for the Game Facilitator</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 6: Optional Rules</strong> offers variations and expansions</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 7: Example Materials</strong> includes sample characters, settings, and play scenarios</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-youll-need"><a class="header" href="#what-youll-need">What You'll Need</a></h2>
<p>To play Narrono, you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>This rulebook</li>
<li>Character sheets (one per player)</li>
<li>Several six-sided dice (at least 3 per player, plus 2-3 for the GF)</li>
<li>Tokens or markers to track asset and relationship states</li>
<li>Writing implements</li>
<li>A group of 2-5 players plus a Game Facilitator</li>
<li>2-4 hours for a typical session</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-begin"><a class="header" href="#lets-begin">Let's Begin</a></h2>
<p>The heart of Narrono lies in creating characters deeply connected to their setting and to each other. As you read through these rules, remember that every mechanical choice is also a narrative one. Your character's traits, assets, and relationships aren't just numbers on a sheet—they're the threads that weave your character into the story.</p>
<p>Now, let's explore the core rules that bring this system to life.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-1-core-rules"><a class="header" href="#chapter-1-core-rules">Chapter 1: Core Rules</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-pool-system-1"><a class="header" href="#the-pool-system-1">The Pool System</a></h2>
<p>At the heart of Narrono lies the Pool System - a flexible dice mechanic that balances narrative possibility with strategic choice. Every significant action your character takes is resolved through this system, creating a framework where your character's traits, assets, and relationships all influence the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="building-your-pool"><a class="header" href="#building-your-pool">Building Your Pool</a></h3>
<p>When your character attempts a significant action, you'll build a dice pool following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with three six-sided dice (3d6) - these represent your base capabilities</li>
<li>Consider which of your character's traits (Origin, Drive, or Goal) best applies to the action</li>
<li>Decide which resolution method you'll use based on trait alignment</li>
<li>Determine if any assets or relationships can support your action</li>
<li>Roll all dice in your pool</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Building a Pool</strong></p>
<p>Kira, a Mountain Clan Warrior, is attempting to intimidate a merchant into revealing information. Her player considers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her Origin trait (Mountain Clan Warrior) strongly applies to intimidation</li>
<li>She has a Fresh "Fearsome Reputation" asset that could help</li>
<li>She decides to use the Direct method since her trait strongly aligns with the action</li>
</ul>
<p>She rolls her 3d6 pool, getting 2, 4, and 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="resolution-methods"><a class="header" href="#resolution-methods">Resolution Methods</a></h3>
<p>The Pool System offers three distinct ways to resolve actions, each representing a different approach to challenges. Your choice of method reflects how your character's traits align with the current action.</p>
<h4 id="direct-method"><a class="header" href="#direct-method">Direct Method</a></h4>
<p><strong>When to use:</strong> Your character's traits strongly support the action<br />
<strong>How it works:</strong> Use the highest die in your pool<br />
<strong>Narrative meaning:</strong> Acting with confidence and natural ability<br />
<strong>Strategic consideration:</strong> Higher chance of success but also higher risk</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Direct Method</strong></p>
<p>Kira uses the Direct method for intimidation since it aligns with her Mountain Clan Warrior trait. From her roll of 2, 4, and 6, she uses the highest die (6), achieving a Success. The merchant nervously reveals what he knows, but word of her intimidation tactics will spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="balanced-method"><a class="header" href="#balanced-method">Balanced Method</a></h4>
<p><strong>When to use:</strong> No traits strongly apply to the action<br />
<strong>How it works:</strong> Use the middle die in your pool<br />
<strong>Narrative meaning:</strong> Taking a measured, careful approach<br />
<strong>Strategic consideration:</strong> Most consistent results with moderate impact</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Balanced Method</strong></p>
<p>Later, Kira needs to negotiate a fair price. No trait strongly applies, so she uses the Balanced method. From a roll of 1, 3, and 5, she uses the middle die (3), achieving a Partial Success. She gets a fair price but must offer something in return.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cautious-method"><a class="header" href="#cautious-method">Cautious Method</a></h4>
<p><strong>When to use:</strong> Acting against your character's trait tendencies<br />
<strong>How it works:</strong> Use the lowest die in your pool<br />
<strong>Narrative meaning:</strong> Carefully handling an unfamiliar situation<br />
<strong>Strategic consideration:</strong> Lower chance of success but reduced risk</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Cautious Method</strong></p>
<p>When Kira must navigate noble court etiquette, she uses the Cautious method since this goes against her direct Mountain Clan ways. From a roll of 2, 3, and 6, she uses the lowest die (2), resulting in a Setback. She makes a social blunder, but learns valuable information about court dynamics in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="understanding-outcomes"><a class="header" href="#understanding-outcomes">Understanding Outcomes</a></h3>
<p>Every action in Narrono results in one of three outcome levels, each with distinct narrative implications:</p>
<h4 id="success-5-6"><a class="header" href="#success-5-6">Success (5-6)</a></h4>
<p>A Success means your character achieves their intention and strengthens their position. You get what you want and gain an additional benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve your stated intention</li>
<li>Strengthen your position in some way</li>
<li>Add a beneficial story element</li>
<li>Potentially improve an asset or relationship condition</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Success Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Kira's intimidation Success (6) means the merchant not only reveals the information she seeks but also offers additional details to stay on her good side. Her reputation for getting results spreads, potentially helping in future interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="partial-success-3-4"><a class="header" href="#partial-success-3-4">Partial Success (3-4)</a></h4>
<p>A Partial Success means your character achieves their intention but at a cost or with a complication:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve your stated intention</li>
<li>Face a minor complication or cost</li>
<li>Create a mixed opportunity</li>
<li>Potentially stress assets or relationships</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Partial Success Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Kira's negotiation Partial Success (3) means she gets the fair price she wanted, but must offer the merchant priority on future goods from her clan. This creates both an opportunity (established trade relationship) and a complication (obligation).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="setback-1-2"><a class="header" href="#setback-1-2">Setback (1-2)</a></h4>
<p>A Setback means your character misses their intention and faces a significant complication:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miss your stated intention</li>
<li>Face a major complication</li>
<li>Assets or relationships may degrade</li>
<li>Create significant story impact</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Setback Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Kira's court etiquette Setback (2) means she not only fails to make a good impression but accidentally insults an important noble. However, another outsider at court notices her struggle and may become a potential ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="asset-integration"><a class="header" href="#asset-integration">Asset Integration</a></h2>
<p>Assets represent your character's equipment, special abilities, and resources. They exist in three states that reflect their condition and availability:</p>
<h3 id="asset-states"><a class="header" href="#asset-states">Asset States</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh:</strong> Providing full benefits and support</li>
<li><strong>Degraded:</strong> Creating complications but still usable</li>
<li><strong>Depleted:</strong> Temporarily unusable until restored</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-assets"><a class="header" href="#using-assets">Using Assets</a></h3>
<p>Assets can support your actions in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> A Fresh asset can add a die to your pool or provide favorable conditions</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> You can risk degrading an asset to reroll a die</li>
<li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Assets can be restored through narrative actions and story opportunities</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset Use</strong></p>
<p>Kira uses her Fresh "Fearsome Reputation" asset when intimidating the merchant, adding a favorable condition to her roll. Later, when negotiating, she risks this asset by leaning too heavily on her reputation, causing it to become Degraded as locals begin to see her as a bully rather than a respected warrior.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-relationship-web"><a class="header" href="#the-relationship-web">The Relationship Web</a></h2>
<p>Relationships in Narrono are more than narrative connections - they're mechanical elements that influence actions and create story opportunities. The Relationship Web connects characters to each other in setting-appropriate ways.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-states"><a class="header" href="#relationship-states">Relationship States</a></h3>
<p>Like assets, relationships exist in multiple states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong:</strong> Provides full benefits and support</li>
<li><strong>Strained:</strong> Creates complications but still provides some benefits</li>
<li><strong>Broken:</strong> Temporarily unusable until restored</li>
<li><strong>Transformed:</strong> Changed into a new type of relationship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-relationships"><a class="header" href="#using-relationships">Using Relationships</a></h3>
<p>Relationships can be used in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> A Strong relationship can add a die to your pool or provide favorable conditions</li>
<li><strong>Combined Actions:</strong> Connected characters can work together for enhanced effects</li>
<li><strong>Asset Sharing:</strong> Relationships enable characters to share certain assets</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> You can risk straining a relationship for greater effect</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Use</strong></p>
<p>Kira has a Strong relationship with Doran, a Merchant Guild Apprentice (former enemies turned allies). When negotiating with the merchant, she can invoke this relationship for support, adding a favorable condition to her roll. However, if she pushes too hard, this relationship could become Strained as Doran's guild connections are compromised.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="relationship-types"><a class="header" href="#relationship-types">Relationship Types</a></h3>
<p>Relationships fall into several categories based on the setting's axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family and Blood Ties:</strong> Siblings, distant relatives, adopted family</li>
<li><strong>Professional Connections:</strong> Colleagues, rivals, partners</li>
<li><strong>Debt and Obligation:</strong> Life-debts, financial entanglements, oaths</li>
<li><strong>Shared History:</strong> Childhood friends, survivors, witnesses</li>
<li><strong>Adversarial Connections:</strong> Former enemies, competing heirs, ideological opponents</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Types</strong></p>
<p>Kira and Doran have an "Adversarial Connection" that has evolved into an "Uneasy Alliance." Their relationship began as "Former Enemies" but transformed through shared experiences. This history creates both opportunities (unique perspectives) and complications (lingering distrust).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-shared-story-pool-1"><a class="header" href="#the-shared-story-pool-1">The Shared Story Pool</a></h2>
<p>The Shared Story Pool represents the group's collective influence on the narrative. At the start of each session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player adds one d6</li>
<li>The GM adds two d6s</li>
<li>Place these dice where all can reach them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-the-shared-story-pool"><a class="header" href="#using-the-shared-story-pool">Using the Shared Story Pool</a></h3>
<p>Players can take dice from the pool to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add Complexity:</strong> Introduce a complication connected to setting elements</li>
<li><strong>Establish Relationships:</strong> Create a connection that fits setting parameters</li>
<li><strong>Create Opportunities:</strong> Add a story element that opens new possibilities</li>
<li><strong>Enhance Rolls:</strong> Add a die to your personal pool with narrative justification</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Shared Story Pool</strong></p>
<p>During the negotiation scene, another player takes a die from the Shared Story Pool to reveal that the merchant has ties to Kira's rivals, adding complexity to the situation. Later, Kira takes a die to establish that she once saved the merchant's daughter, creating a new relationship that could help in future interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</a></h2>
<p>The true power of Narrono's system emerges when these elements work together. Consider this integrated example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Integrated Example: The Merchant Negotiation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> Kira needs to negotiate for supplies while hiding her true purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Trait Consideration:</strong> Her Origin (Mountain Clan Warrior) doesn't strongly apply, suggesting a Balanced approach.</p>
<p><strong>Asset Integration:</strong> Her "Trade Routes Knowledge" asset is Fresh and can provide support.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Use:</strong> Her Strong relationship with Doran gives her insight into guild practices.</p>
<p><strong>Method Choice:</strong> She chooses the Balanced method due to mixed trait relevance.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Building:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base pool: 3d6</li>
<li>Fresh asset provides favorable condition</li>
<li>Relationship with Doran provides additional insight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roll Result:</strong> 2, 4, 5</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Using the middle die (4), Kira achieves a Partial Success.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Resolution:</strong> Kira secures the supplies at a fair price (achieving intention) but must reveal part of her journey plans to the merchant (complication). Her knowledge of trade routes (asset) helps identify the best deals, while Doran's advice (relationship) helps her navigate guild customs. The merchant agrees to keep her secret but will expect a favor in return.</p>
<p><strong>Story Development:</strong> Another player takes a die from the Shared Story Pool to establish that the merchant has connections to a faction Kira will encounter later, creating a future story opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="the-foundation-of-your-story"><a class="header" href="#the-foundation-of-your-story">The Foundation of Your Story</a></h2>
<p>In Narrono, your setting isn't just a backdrop—it's the foundation from which characters, conflicts, and stories emerge. The choices you make about your world directly shape what traits are available to characters, what assets make sense, and what kinds of relationships form between them.</p>
<p>This chapter guides you through creating a setting using the Five Axes framework—a system that helps you make clear, meaningful choices about your world's fundamental aspects. By the end, you'll have a rich, coherent setting that generates interesting character options and story possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-axes-framework"><a class="header" href="#the-five-axes-framework">The Five Axes Framework</a></h2>
<p>The Five Axes framework helps create unique settings by making clear choices about fundamental aspects of the world. Each axis presents distinct options that combine to create different possibilities. These aren't sliding scales—each choice brings certain elements into focus while pushing others to the background.</p>
<h3 id="power-scale"><a class="header" href="#power-scale">Power Scale</a></h3>
<p>The Power Scale axis determines the scope of meaningful action in your setting—what level of influence can characters realistically achieve?</p>

<h2 id="creating-your-setting"><a class="header" href="#creating-your-setting">Creating Your Setting</a></h2>
<p>Now that you understand the Five Axes, let's walk through the process of creating a setting for your game. This is typically a collaborative process involving all players and the Game Master.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-discuss-themes-and-tone"><a class="header" href="#step-1-discuss-themes-and-tone">Step 1: Discuss Themes and Tone</a></h3>
<p>Before selecting specific axis positions, have a conversation about the themes and tone you want to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kinds of stories interest your group?</li>
<li>What genres do you enjoy?</li>
<li>What themes would you like to explore?</li>
<li>What tone feels right—gritty realism, hopeful adventure, dark intrigue?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Theme Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The group discusses their interests and decides they want to explore themes of tradition versus progress in a setting where supernatural elements are emerging into a previously mundane world. They're interested in personal stories with significant community impact, and they want a tone that balances hope with tension.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-2-select-axis-positions"><a class="header" href="#step-2-select-axis-positions">Step 2: Select Axis Positions</a></h3>
<p>Work through each axis, discussing the options and selecting the position that best supports your desired themes and tone. Remember that each choice influences the others, so consider how they interact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Axis Selection</strong></p>
<p>Based on their theme discussion, the group makes these choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Scale:</strong> Local (community-level impact)</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural:</strong> Hidden (emerging supernatural elements)</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> Moderate (industrial age with traditional elements)</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure:</strong> Hierarchical (tradition versus progress)</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Type:</strong> Social (emphasis on relationships and influence)</li>
</ul>
<p>They name their setting "Shadowtide Harbor."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-3-explore-implications-and-connections"><a class="header" href="#step-3-explore-implications-and-connections">Step 3: Explore Implications and Connections</a></h3>
<p>Once you've selected your axis positions, discuss how they interact and what implications they create:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the Power Scale affect what supernatural elements exist?</li>
<li>How does Technology interact with Social Structure?</li>
<li>How does Conflict Type shape relationships between groups?</li>
</ul>
<p>Document these connections to create a coherent world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Exploring Connections</strong></p>
<p>The group explores connections in Shadowtide Harbor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hidden Supernatural means magical abilities are emerging among people from all social classes, disrupting the Hierarchical structure</li>
<li>Moderate Technology creates tension between traditional crafts and industrial methods</li>
<li>Local Power Scale means supernatural events affect neighborhoods differently</li>
<li>Social Conflict means that influence and alliances determine how supernatural elements are handled</li>
</ul>
<p>They note that the harbor's old aristocratic families are losing influence as supernatural abilities emerge among common people, creating new power dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-4-develop-key-setting-elements"><a class="header" href="#step-4-develop-key-setting-elements">Step 4: Develop Key Setting Elements</a></h3>
<p>With your axis choices and their implications understood, develop specific elements that will feature in your setting:</p>
<h4 id="organizations-and-factions"><a class="header" href="#organizations-and-factions">Organizations and Factions</a></h4>
<p>Identify the major groups that shape your setting, considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is their purpose or goal?</li>
<li>How do they relate to the axes?</li>
<li>Who leads them and how?</li>
<li>What resources do they control?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Organizations in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Harbor Council:</strong> Traditional aristocratic families trying to maintain control</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="locations"><a class="header" href="#locations">Locations</a></h4>
<p>Develop the important places in your setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they reflect your axis choices?</li>
<li>What conflicts center around them?</li>
<li>Who controls or inhabits them?</li>
<li>What resources or opportunities do they provide?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Locations in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Old Harbor District:</strong> Traditional area controlled by aristocratic families</li>
<li><strong>Factory Quarter:</strong> Industrial zone where working classes live and work</li>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="resources-and-assets"><a class="header" href="#resources-and-assets">Resources and Assets</a></h4>
<p>Identify what people value and compete for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What resources are scarce or valuable?</li>
<li>What assets provide advantage?</li>
<li>How do these connect to your axis choices?</li>
<li>Who controls these resources?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Resources in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shadowcoal:</strong> Rare fuel that enhances both machines and supernatural abilities</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-5-identify-conflicts-and-tensions"><a class="header" href="#step-5-identify-conflicts-and-tensions">Step 5: Identify Conflicts and Tensions</a></h3>
<p>Based on your axis choices and setting elements, identify the central conflicts and tensions that will drive stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>What groups are in opposition?</li>
<li>What resources are contested?</li>
<li>What changes are occurring?</li>
<li>What traditions are threatened?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Conflicts in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tradition vs. Progress:</strong> Old families resist industrial and supernatural changes</li>
<li><strong>Class Struggle:</strong> Working classes gain power through industry and supernatural abilities</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Control:</strong> Competition to discover and control supernatural knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Resource Competition:</strong> Conflict over shadowcoal and other valuable resources</li>
<li><strong>Identity Crisis:</strong> People with emerging abilities struggle with changing identity</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="setting-character-integration"><a class="header" href="#setting-character-integration">Setting-Character Integration</a></h2>
<p>One of Narrono's core principles is that characters emerge from their settings. The axis choices you've made directly shape what character traits, assets, and relationships make sense.</p>
<h3 id="character-traits-1"><a class="header" href="#character-traits-1">Character Traits</a></h3>
<p>Remember that character traits connect directly to setting elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Shaped by Social Structure</li>
<li><strong>Drive:</strong> Shaped by Conflict Type</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Shaped by Power Scale</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Traits in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin options</strong> (based on Hierarchical Social Structure):</p>
<ul>
<li>Harbor Aristocrat</li>
<li>Guild Artisan</li>
<li>Factory Worker</li>
<li>Merchant Family</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drive options</strong> (based on Social Conflict Type):</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserve Tradition</li>
<li>Gain Recognition</li>
<li>Forge Alliances</li>
<li>Uncover Secrets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goal options</strong> (based on Local Power Scale):</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Harbor District</li>
<li>Lead Guild Operations</li>
<li>Unite Working Classes</li>
<li>Establish New Order</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="available-assets"><a class="header" href="#available-assets">Available Assets</a></h3>
<p>Your axis choices determine what assets make sense in your setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology Level influences what tools and equipment exist</li>
<li>Supernatural Level determines what magical or extraordinary items are available</li>
<li>Social Structure shapes what status symbols and positions exist</li>
<li>Power Scale affects what resources can be controlled</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Assets in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical Assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Steam-powered devices (Moderate Technology)</li>
<li>Family heirlooms (Hierarchical Society)</li>
<li>Shadowcoal reserves (Valuable Resource)</li>
<li>Hidden sanctums (Hidden Supernatural)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guild membership (Professional Organization)</li>
<li>Family name (Hierarchical Status)</li>
<li>Neighborhood influence (Local Power)</li>
<li>Secret society position (Hidden Supernatural)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="relationship-types-1"><a class="header" href="#relationship-types-1">Relationship Types</a></h3>
<p>Your axis choices also determine what relationship types are common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Structure influences family and community connections</li>
<li>Conflict Type shapes professional and adversarial relationships</li>
<li>Power Scale affects the scope and nature of obligations</li>
<li>Supernatural Level determines special or unusual connections</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationships in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Relationship Types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Family Alliances (Hierarchical Society)</li>
<li>Guild Mentorships (Professional Connections)</li>
<li>Class Solidarity (Social Conflict)</li>
<li>Supernatural Bonds (Hidden Supernatural)</li>
<li>Neighborhood Ties (Local Power)</li>
<li>Trade Partnerships (Economic Elements)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="setting-evolution"><a class="header" href="#setting-evolution">Setting Evolution</a></h2>
<p>Settings in Narrono aren't static—they evolve through play as characters affect their world. Understanding how settings change helps you create dynamic, responsive worlds.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-change"><a class="header" href="#understanding-change">Understanding Change</a></h3>
<p>Changes happen at three levels:</p>
<h4 id="1-element-changes"><a class="header" href="#1-element-changes">1. Element Changes</a></h4>
<p>These are shifts within the current axis positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New factions emerge within existing structures</li>
<li>Relationships between groups shift</li>
<li>Resources become available or scarce</li>
<li>Knowledge spreads or becomes restricted</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Element Changes in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new faction forms within the Harbor Council</li>
<li>The relationship between the Mechanics Guild and Twilight Circle shifts from hostile to cooperative</li>
<li>A new vein of shadowcoal is discovered</li>
<li>Knowledge of a specific supernatural ability becomes more widespread</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="2-internal-axis-shifts"><a class="header" href="#2-internal-axis-shifts">2. Internal Axis Shifts</a></h4>
<p>These are changes within an axis choice that don't jump to a new category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power structures reorganize within their scale</li>
<li>Supernatural forces find new expressions</li>
<li>Technology develops within its level</li>
<li>Social structures adapt while maintaining their nature</li>
<li>Conflict patterns evolve within their type</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Internal Shifts in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Harbor Council reforms its leadership structure (within Hierarchical)</li>
<li>New types of supernatural abilities emerge (within Hidden)</li>
<li>Advanced steam technology develops (within Moderate)</li>
<li>Social influence tactics evolve (within Social Conflict)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="3-axis-transitions"><a class="header" href="#3-axis-transitions">3. Axis Transitions</a></h4>
<p>These are major changes that move from one axis choice to another:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require significant story events</li>
<li>Should feel earned through play</li>
<li>Create lasting consequences</li>
<li>Usually happen gradually</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Potential Axis Transition in Shadowtide Harbor</strong></p>
<p>After many sessions of play, the characters' actions lead to supernatural abilities becoming publicly known and acknowledged, shifting the Supernatural Level from Hidden to Open. This creates cascading effects across the setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>New regulations for supernatural abilities</li>
<li>Public institutions for supernatural training</li>
<li>Changed social dynamics as abilities become status markers</li>
<li>Evolved conflict patterns as supernatural elements enter public discourse</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="managing-evolution"><a class="header" href="#managing-evolution">Managing Evolution</a></h3>
<h4 id="gradual-change"><a class="header" href="#gradual-change">Gradual Change</a></h4>
<p>Most evolution should happen slowly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish current state clearly</li>
<li>Show signs of potential change</li>
<li>Create opportunities for character influence</li>
<li>Let consequences ripple outward</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Gradual Change</strong></p>
<p>The transition from Hidden to Open Supernatural might follow this progression:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rumors of strange abilities begin to circulate</li>
<li>Public incidents become harder to cover up</li>
<li>Characters have opportunities to reveal or conceal supernatural events</li>
<li>Based on their choices, public awareness grows or is suppressed</li>
<li>Eventually, a tipping point is reached where denial is no longer possible</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="sudden-shifts"><a class="header" href="#sudden-shifts">Sudden Shifts</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes dramatic events force rapid change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be rare and significant</li>
<li>Must emerge from character actions</li>
<li>Create immediate problems</li>
<li>Require adaptation</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Sudden Shift</strong></p>
<p>A catastrophic event at the harbor—perhaps a massive supernatural manifestation during a public ceremony—could force an immediate shift from Hidden to Open Supernatural, creating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate panic and confusion</li>
<li>Rapid policy responses</li>
<li>Social upheaval</li>
<li>New threats and opportunities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="random-generation"><a class="header" href="#random-generation">Random Generation</a></h3>
<p>If you want inspiration or a starting point, try this random generation approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Roll a d6 for each axis (or use a random number generator):</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2: First option</li>
<li>3-4: Second option</li>
<li>5-6: Third option</li>
<li>Reroll 5-6 for Conflict Type (which has only four options)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze the combination for coherence</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it make logical sense?</li>
<li>Are there interesting tensions?</li>
<li>What themes emerge?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust as needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Change one axis if the combination seems contradictory</li>
<li>Emphasize interesting connections</li>
<li>Build on emergent themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Random Generation</strong></p>
<p>Rolling for each axis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power Scale: 5 = Regional</li>
<li>Supernatural: 2 = Hidden</li>
<li>Technology: 3 = Moderate</li>
<li>Social Structure: 1 = Tribal</li>
<li>Conflict Type: 4 = Ideological</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates an interesting combination: tribal societies with regional influence, hidden supernatural elements, moderate (industrial) technology, and ideological conflicts. This might suggest a setting where tribal societies have grown to control regions through industrial resources, while secretly using supernatural powers, and competing based on different belief systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ai-assistance"><a class="header" href="#ai-assistance">AI Assistance</a></h3>
<p>Narrono includes an AI Setting Generation Agent that can help you develop setting ideas. The AI can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate random settings based on axis combinations</li>
<li>Analyze the implications of your chosen axes</li>
<li>Suggest organizations, locations, and conflicts</li>
<li>Help identify potential contradictions</li>
<li>Offer character trait and asset examples</li>
</ul>
<p>To use the AI Setting Generation Agent, provide your desired axis choices or ask for a random generation. The AI will analyze the combination and provide detailed setting elements based on the Five Axes framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: AI Setting Generation</strong></p>
<p>A player might ask the AI: "Generate a setting with Hidden Supernatural, Advanced Technology, and Merit-based Social Structure. Let the AI choose the other axes."</p>
<p>The AI would analyze this combination, select complementary options for the remaining axes, and generate a complete setting with organizations, locations, conflicts, and character options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that the AI is a tool to inspire and assist, not replace your group's creativity. Use its suggestions as starting points that you can modify, expand, or completely reimagine based on your group's interests.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-your-setting-your-story"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-your-setting-your-story">Conclusion: Your Setting, Your Story</a></h2>
<p>The Five Axes framework provides a structured approach to creating settings that generate interesting character options and story possibilities. By making clear choices about your world's fundamental aspects, you create a foundation for rich, coherent storytelling.</p>
<p>Remember these key principles as you create and evolve your setting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Settings Shape Characters:</strong> The choices you make about your world directly influence what character traits, assets, and relationships make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coherence Creates Depth:</strong> When your axis choices interact logically, they create a world that feels real and lived-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conflicts Drive Stories:</strong> The tensions that naturally emerge from your axis choices provide the fuel for compelling narratives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Settings Evolve:</strong> Your world will change through play as characters influence their environment and respond to events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration Enhances Creativity:</strong> Creating a setting together ensures everyone has a stake in the world and understands its possibilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore how to create characters deeply connected to your setting, with traits, assets, and relationships that emerge naturally from the world you've built.</p>

<h2 id="characters-shaped-by-setting"><a class="header" href="#characters-shaped-by-setting">Characters Shaped by Setting</a></h2>
<p>In Narrono, characters don't exist in isolation—they emerge from their setting, shaped by its fundamental aspects. The choices you made during setting creation directly influence what character options make sense, what traits are available, and what kinds of relationships can form between characters.</p>
<p>This chapter guides you through creating characters that are deeply integrated with your setting through the trait and asset system. You'll learn how to develop characters whose origins, drives, and goals naturally emerge from the world you've built, and how to connect them through the Relationship Web.</p>
<h2 id="the-character-creation-process"><a class="header" href="#the-character-creation-process">The Character Creation Process</a></h2>
<p>Creating characters in Narrono follows a structured process that ensures they're firmly rooted in your setting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Develop Traits:</strong> Create three core traits (Origin, Drive, Goal) that emerge from setting elements</li>
<li><strong>Build Assets:</strong> Develop assets that connect to traits and reflect setting elements</li>
<li><strong>Establish Relationships:</strong> Create the Relationship Web between characters</li>
<li><strong>Finalize Details:</strong> Complete your character sheet with connections and story elements</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's explore each step in detail.</p>
<h2 id="developing-character-traits"><a class="header" href="#developing-character-traits">Developing Character Traits</a></h2>
<p>Every character in Narrono is defined by three core traits that emerge directly from your setting's axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Shaped by Social Structure</li>
<li><strong>Drive:</strong> Shaped by Conflict Type</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Shaped by Power Scale</li>
</ul>
<p>These traits aren't just descriptive labels—they're the foundation of how your character interacts with the world and its mechanics. Each trait influences which resolution method (Direct, Balanced, or Cautious) works best in different situations.</p>
<h3 id="origin-shaped-by-social-structure"><a class="header" href="#origin-shaped-by-social-structure">Origin: Shaped by Social Structure</a></h3>
<p>Your character's Origin represents their background, upbringing, and position within the social framework of your setting. It answers the question: "Where do I come from?"</p>
<h4 id="how-social-structure-shapes-origin"><a class="header" href="#how-social-structure-shapes-origin">How Social Structure Shapes Origin</a></h4>
<p>Each Social Structure option creates different Origin possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Tribal Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clan Member</li>
<li>Tribal Elder</li>
<li>Outcast</li>
<li>Shaman/Spiritual Leader</li>
<li>Nomadic Trader</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hierarchical Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Noble/Aristocrat</li>
<li>Clergy/Priest</li>
<li>Merchant/Artisan</li>
<li>Commoner/Laborer</li>
<li>Outsider/Foreigner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merit-based Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proven Expert</li>
<li>Rising Talent</li>
<li>Self-Made Success</li>
<li>Academy Graduate</li>
<li>Unrecognized Genius</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fluid Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trend-Setter</li>
<li>Adaptable Survivor</li>
<li>Network Hub</li>
<li>Identity Shifter</li>
<li>Cultural Translator</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Origin Development</strong></p>
<p>In "Shadow Court" (with Hierarchical Social Structure), Mira develops the Origin "Third Tier Noble of House Vayne." This places her in the aristocracy but not at its highest levels, creating both opportunities and limitations.</p>
<p>In "Frontier Clans" (with Tribal Social Structure), Karn develops the Origin "Exiled Hunter of the Bear Clan." This establishes his skills and connections while also creating immediate complications.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="origin-connections"><a class="header" href="#origin-connections">Origin Connections</a></h4>
<p>Each Origin should include three connections that create story hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bond:</strong> A positive relationship or connection</li>
<li><strong>Complication:</strong> A problem or challenge</li>
<li><strong>Weakness:</strong> A limitation or vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Origin Connections</strong></p>
<p>For Mira's "Third Tier Noble of House Vayne" Origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond: Loyal Family Retainers</li>
<li>Complication: Succession Dispute</li>
<li>Weakness: Public Scrutiny</li>
</ul>
<p>For Karn's "Exiled Hunter of the Bear Clan" Origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond: Secret Clan Allies</li>
<li>Complication: Blood Debt</li>
<li>Weakness: Outsider Status</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="drive-shaped-by-conflict-type"><a class="header" href="#drive-shaped-by-conflict-type">Drive: Shaped by Conflict Type</a></h3>
<p>Your character's Drive represents their motivation and preferred approach to solving problems. It answers the question: "What pushes me forward?"</p>
<h4 id="how-conflict-type-shapes-drive"><a class="header" href="#how-conflict-type-shapes-drive">How Conflict Type Shapes Drive</a></h4>
<p>Each Conflict Type option creates different Drive possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Direct Conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protect Through Strength</li>
<li>Conquer Through Force</li>
<li>Survive Through Skill</li>
<li>Defend Through Vigilance</li>
<li>Lead Through Action</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Influence Through Charm</li>
<li>Control Through Secrets</li>
<li>Rise Through Connections</li>
<li>Protect Through Reputation</li>
<li>Unify Through Leadership</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economic Conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Profit Through Trade</li>
<li>Control Through Resources</li>
<li>Build Through Investment</li>
<li>Secure Through Acquisition</li>
<li>Innovate Through Opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideological Conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Convert Through Faith</li>
<li>Reform Through Vision</li>
<li>Preserve Through Tradition</li>
<li>Enlighten Through Knowledge</li>
<li>Liberate Through Revolution</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Drive Development</strong></p>
<p>In "Shadow Court" (with Social Conflict), Mira develops the Drive "Secure Power Through Secret Knowledge." This reflects how influence in her setting comes through social maneuvering and hidden information.</p>
<p>In "Frontier Clans" (with Direct Conflict), Karn develops the Drive "Reclaim Honor Through Proven Strength." This aligns with his setting's emphasis on direct action and physical capability.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="drive-connections"><a class="header" href="#drive-connections">Drive Connections</a></h4>
<p>Like Origin, each Drive should include three connections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bond:</strong> A relationship that supports this Drive</li>
<li><strong>Complication:</strong> A challenge this Drive creates</li>
<li><strong>Weakness:</strong> A vulnerability this Drive exposes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Drive Connections</strong></p>
<p>For Mira's "Secure Power Through Secret Knowledge" Drive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond: Hidden Archive Keeper</li>
<li>Complication: Dangerous Information</li>
<li>Weakness: Obsessive Research</li>
</ul>
<p>For Karn's "Reclaim Honor Through Proven Strength" Drive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond: Respected Warrior Mentor</li>
<li>Complication: Reckless Challenges</li>
<li>Weakness: Prideful Decisions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="goal-shaped-by-power-scale"><a class="header" href="#goal-shaped-by-power-scale">Goal: Shaped by Power Scale</a></h3>
<p>Your character's Goal represents their ambition and what they hope to achieve. It answers the question: "What am I working toward?"</p>
<h4 id="how-power-scale-shapes-goal"><a class="header" href="#how-power-scale-shapes-goal">How Power Scale Shapes Goal</a></h4>
<p>Each Power Scale option creates different Goal possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Power Scale</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Master a Skill</li>
<li>Protect a Loved One</li>
<li>Discover Personal Truth</li>
<li>Overcome Personal Limitation</li>
<li>Find Inner Peace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Local Power Scale</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lead Community</li>
<li>Change Local Tradition</li>
<li>Control Neighborhood</li>
<li>Establish Local Business</li>
<li>Solve Community Problem</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regional Power Scale</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gain Political Office</li>
<li>Reform Institution</li>
<li>Control Trade Routes</li>
<li>Unite Rival Factions</li>
<li>Discover Regional Secret</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Power Scale</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change World History</li>
<li>Control Global Resource</li>
<li>Lead International Movement</li>
<li>Discover World-Changing Knowledge</li>
<li>Reshape Power Structure</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Goal Development</strong></p>
<p>In "Shadow Court" (with Local Power Scale), Mira develops the Goal "Reshape House Influence in Harbor District." This fits the local scope of power in her setting.</p>
<p>In "Frontier Clans" (with Regional Power Scale), Karn develops the Goal "Unite the Three Border Clans." This reflects the regional scope of his setting's conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="goal-connections"><a class="header" href="#goal-connections">Goal Connections</a></h4>
<p>Each Goal should include three connections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bond:</strong> A relationship that helps achieve this Goal</li>
<li><strong>Complication:</strong> An obstacle to this Goal</li>
<li><strong>Weakness:</strong> A personal limitation affecting this Goal</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Goal Connections</strong></p>
<p>For Mira's "Reshape House Influence in Harbor District" Goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond: Reform-Minded Peers</li>
<li>Complication: Conservative Opposition</li>
<li>Weakness: Idealistic Assumptions</li>
</ul>
<p>For Karn's "Unite the Three Border Clans" Goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond: Clan Elder Advocate</li>
<li>Complication: Ancient Blood Feuds</li>
<li>Weakness: Lack of Diplomatic Experience</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="trait-integration"><a class="header" href="#trait-integration">Trait Integration</a></h3>
<p>Your three traits should work together to create a coherent character. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does your Origin influence your Drive?</li>
<li>How does your Drive support your Goal?</li>
<li>What tensions exist between your traits?</li>
<li>How do your traits connect to setting elements?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Trait Integration</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mira's Traits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Origin: Third Tier Noble of House Vayne</li>
<li>Drive: Secure Power Through Secret Knowledge</li>
<li>Goal: Reshape House Influence in Harbor District</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Integration:</strong> Mira's position as a Third Tier Noble gives her access to court but limited direct power, driving her to seek influence through secrets. Her goal of reshaping House influence focuses her drive on specific local politics rather than broader ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Karn's Traits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Origin: Exiled Hunter of the Bear Clan</li>
<li>Drive: Reclaim Honor Through Proven Strength</li>
<li>Goal: Unite the Three Border Clans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Integration:</strong> Karn's exile status creates the need to reclaim honor, while his hunter background gives him skills but not political standing. His goal of uniting clans provides a path to both restore his honor and create a place where exiles like him might belong.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="building-character-assets"><a class="header" href="#building-character-assets">Building Character Assets</a></h2>
<p>Assets represent your character's equipment, special abilities, resources, and advantages. They provide mechanical support for actions and create story opportunities through their use and potential degradation.</p>
<h3 id="asset-development-process"><a class="header" href="#asset-development-process">Asset Development Process</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Create three assets that connect to your character's traits</li>
<li>Ensure each asset reflects appropriate setting elements</li>
<li>Establish how assets can be used and risked</li>
<li>Consider how assets might evolve through play</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="asset-types"><a class="header" href="#asset-types">Asset Types</a></h3>
<p>Assets fall into several categories based on your setting's axes:</p>
<h4 id="physical-assets"><a class="header" href="#physical-assets">Physical Assets</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Physical Assets: Dueling rapier, disguise kit, cipher tools</li>
<li>Social Assets: Noble title, guild membership, court invitation</li>

<li>Social Assets: Tribal markings, elder's blessing, blood oath</li>
<li>Knowledge Assets: Survival skills, clan histories, trade routes</li>
<li>Supernatural Assets: None (due to None Supernatural Level)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asset-creation-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#asset-creation-guidelines">Asset Creation Guidelines</a></h3>
<p>When creating assets, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setting Consistency:</strong> Assets must make sense within your setting's axes</li>
<li><strong>Trait Connection:</strong> Each asset should connect to at least one trait</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Potential:</strong> Assets should create story opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical Utility:</strong> Assets should provide clear benefits in appropriate situations</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset Creation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mira creates three assets:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Family Grimoire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to: Origin (Third Tier Noble)</li>
<li>Setting Elements: Hidden Supernatural, Hierarchical Social Structure</li>
<li>Description: Ancient book containing family secrets and minor rituals</li>
<li>Mechanical Use: Provides knowledge about noble houses and minor magical effects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network of Informants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to: Drive (Secure Power Through Secret Knowledge)</li>
<li>Setting Elements: Local Power Scale, Social Conflict</li>
<li>Description: Eyes and ears throughout the Harbor District</li>
<li>Mechanical Use: Provides information and social leverage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ancestral Signet Ring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to: Goal (Reshape House Influence)</li>
<li>Setting Elements: Hierarchical Social Structure, Moderate Technology</li>
<li>Description: Symbol of family authority that grants access to certain areas</li>
<li>Mechanical Use: Provides social authority and authentication</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Karn creates three assets:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Master-Crafted Hunting Bow</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to: Origin (Exiled Hunter)</li>
<li>Setting Elements: Limited Technology, Tribal Social Structure</li>
<li>Description: Exceptional bow made with traditional techniques</li>
<li>Mechanical Use: Provides advantage in hunting and combat</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asset-states-1"><a class="header" href="#asset-states-1">Asset States</a></h3>
<p>Remember that assets exist in three states that reflect their condition and availability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh:</strong> Providing full benefits and support</li>
<li><strong>Degraded:</strong> Creating complications but still usable</li>
<li><strong>Depleted:</strong> Temporarily unusable until restored</li>
</ul>
<p>Assets can change state through use, risk, and narrative events. When an asset becomes Degraded or Depleted, it creates both mechanical limitations and story opportunities for restoration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset States in Play</strong></p>
<p>Mira's "Network of Informants" starts Fresh, providing reliable information. After using it to uncover sensitive information about a powerful rival, it becomes Degraded as some informants are compromised. This creates complications (less reliable information) but also story opportunities (how to protect her remaining sources).</p>
<p>If the network later becomes Depleted through further risk or narrative events, it becomes temporarily unusable until Mira takes actions to rebuild it, perhaps by establishing new contacts or creating new cover identities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="establishing-the-relationship-web"><a class="header" href="#establishing-the-relationship-web">Establishing the Relationship Web</a></h2>
<p>The Relationship Web connects characters to each other in setting-appropriate ways, creating both narrative bonds and mechanical support systems. Unlike many games where character connections are established during individual creation, Narrono implements the Relationship Web after all characters are developed.</p>
<h3 id="the-relationship-web-process"><a class="header" href="#the-relationship-web-process">The Relationship Web Process</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Each player introduces their character's traits and assets</li>
<li>Players collaboratively establish relationships between characters</li>
<li>Each relationship is defined by type, state, and connections</li>
<li>The group ensures relationships make sense within the setting</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="relationship-types-2"><a class="header" href="#relationship-types-2">Relationship Types</a></h3>
<p>Relationships fall into several categories based on your setting's axes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Siblings: Rivalry, responsibility, shared legacy</li>

<li>Betrayer and Betrayed: Broken trust</li>
<li>Hunter and Quarry: Pursuit turned partnership</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Types in Different Settings</strong></p>
<p>In "Shadow Court" (Local/Hidden/Moderate/Hierarchical/Social):</p>
<ul>
<li>Family Ties: Competing noble cousins, distant relation with secret claim</li>
<li>Professional: Court advisor and noble patron, guild master and apprentice</li>
<li>Debt: Life-debt for saving from assassination, blackmail over secret magic</li>
<li>Shared History: Childhood friends from academy, witnesses to royal scandal</li>
<li>Adversarial: Former rivals now allied against common threat, competing heirs</li>
</ul>
<p>In "Frontier Clans" (Regional/None/Limited/Tribal/Direct):</p>
<ul>
<li>Family Ties: Siblings from rival clans, adopted into different tribes</li>
<li>Professional: Mentor and student hunters, rival traders</li>
<li>Debt: Blood oath of protection, life-debt for rescue in wilderness</li>

<p>Like assets, relationships exist in multiple states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong:</strong> Provides full benefits and support</li>
<li><strong>Strained:</strong> Creates complications but still provides some benefits</li>
<li><strong>Broken:</strong> Temporarily unusable until restored</li>
<li><strong>Transformed:</strong> Changed into a new type of relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationships can change state through play, creating both mechanical effects and narrative developments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship States</strong></p>
<p>Mira and another character, Lord Darius (a Military Commander), have a "Debt and Obligation" relationship that begins as Strong. This provides mutual support in appropriate situations.</p>
<p>If Mira asks for help that compromises Darius's military duties, the relationship might become Strained, creating complications while still providing limited benefits.</p>
<p>If Mira later betrays Darius's trust completely, the relationship could become Broken, requiring significant narrative resolution before it can be used again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, through play, their relationship might Transform from "Debt and Obligation" to "Professional Connection" or even "Family Tie" (through marriage or adoption), changing its nature and benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="creating-character-relationships"><a class="header" href="#creating-character-relationships">Creating Character Relationships</a></h3>
<p>When establishing relationships between characters, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setting Consistency:</strong> Relationships should make sense within your setting's axes</li>
<li><strong>Trait Connections:</strong> How do character traits influence the relationship?</li>
<li><strong>Asset Interactions:</strong> What assets might be shared or connected?</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Potential:</strong> What story opportunities does the relationship create?</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical Support:</strong> How can characters support each other mechanically?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Creation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Relationship between Mira and Karn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Debt and Obligation - Inherited Obligation</li>
<li><strong>State:</strong> Strong</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Mira's family has a generations-old obligation to protect Karn's clan during times of hardship, stemming from an ancient alliance.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical Benefits:</strong> Mira can provide social support in noble circles; Karn can provide protection and wilderness guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Complications:</strong> Mira's family considers the debt outdated; Karn's clan expects more than Mira can deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Assets:</strong> Mira can access Karn's Border Maps; Karn can benefit from Mira's Family Grimoire for certain rituals.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Potential:</strong> Could evolve into a true alliance beyond obligation, or strain under conflicting goals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-complete-relationship-web"><a class="header" href="#the-complete-relationship-web">The Complete Relationship Web</a></h3>
<p>Once all character relationships are established, you'll have a complete Relationship Web that connects the entire group. This web should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create meaningful connections between all characters</li>
<li>Establish clear mechanical support options</li>
<li>Generate interesting narrative tensions</li>
<li>Reflect the setting's fundamental aspects</li>
<li>Allow for evolution through play</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Web Visualization</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD
    Mira["Mira"] --- |"Inherited Obligation (Strong)"| Karn["Karn"]
    Mira --- |"Former Rivals (Strained)"| Darius["Lord Darius"]
    Karn --- |"Blood Brothers (Strong)"| Thana["Thana"]

    Darius --- |"Mentor-Student (Strong)"| Elara["Elara"]
    Thana --- |"Life-Debt (Strong)"| Elara
    Elara --- |"Secret Partners (Strong)"| Mira
</code></pre>
<p>This web shows how five characters are interconnected, with each relationship having a type and state. It creates a complex network of support options and potential complications.</p>

<h2 id="character-evolution"><a class="header" href="#character-evolution">Character Evolution</a></h2>
<p>Characters in Narrono aren't static—they evolve through play as they interact with their setting and each other. Understanding how characters change helps you plan for long-term development.</p>
<h3 id="trait-evolution"><a class="header" href="#trait-evolution">Trait Evolution</a></h3>
<p>Characters develop through their traits' interaction with the setting:</p>
<h4 id="origin-social-structure"><a class="header" href="#origin-social-structure">Origin (Social Structure)</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Develop new connections within social framework</li>
<li>Navigate changing status and position</li>
<li>Face challenges to traditional roles</li>
<li>Build or strain relationships</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-conflict-type"><a class="header" href="#drive-conflict-type">Drive (Conflict Type)</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Adapt methods to new challenges</li>
<li>Discover alternative approaches</li>
<li>Face conflicting motivations</li>
<li>Evolve goals and methods</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="goal-power-scale"><a class="header" href="#goal-power-scale">Goal (Power Scale)</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Expand or focus ambitions</li>
<li>Deal with changing scope</li>
<li>Navigate new power dynamics</li>
<li>Adjust to achieved objectives</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Trait Evolution</strong></p>
<p>Mira's Origin as a "Third Tier Noble" might evolve as she gains influence, perhaps becoming "Rising Power in House Vayne" to reflect her changing status.</p>
<p>Her Drive to "Secure Power Through Secret Knowledge" might shift to "Reform System Through Revealed Truths" as her motivations change from personal power to systemic change.</p>
<p>Her Goal to "Reshape House Influence" might expand to "Transform Harbor District Politics" as her ambitions grow beyond her family.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asset-development"><a class="header" href="#asset-development">Asset Development</a></h3>
<p>Assets evolve through use and story:</p>
<h4 id="state-management"><a class="header" href="#state-management">State Management</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fresh → Full benefits and opportunities</li>
<li>Degraded → Limited use with complications</li>
<li>Depleted → Temporarily unusable, needs recovery</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recovery-methods"><a class="header" href="#recovery-methods">Recovery Methods</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Through narrative resolution</li>
<li>Using group resources</li>
<li>Creating story opportunities</li>
<li>Leveraging relationships</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="evolution-paths"><a class="header" href="#evolution-paths">Evolution Paths</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade existing capabilities</li>
<li>Add new features or aspects</li>
<li>Transform through story events</li>
<li>Combine with other assets</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset Evolution</strong></p>
<p>Mira's "Family Grimoire" might evolve from a collection of family secrets to a powerful magical tome as she discovers hidden pages or deciphers obscure passages.</p>
<p>Her "Network of Informants" might expand from the Harbor District to cover multiple districts, or specialize in supernatural information as her focus changes.</p>
<p>Her "Ancestral Signet Ring" might reveal hidden powers or be modified to serve new purposes as she learns more about her family's history.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="relationship-evolution"><a class="header" href="#relationship-evolution">Relationship Evolution</a></h3>
<p>Relationships develop through play and interaction:</p>
<h4 id="state-changes"><a class="header" href="#state-changes">State Changes</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Strong → Strengthened through shared successes</li>
<li>Strained → Tested by conflicts and choices</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Evolution</strong></p>
<p>Mira's "Inherited Obligation" relationship with Karn might transform into a true friendship as they work together beyond the bounds of traditional obligation.</p>
<p>Her relationship with Lord Darius might strain if their goals conflict, requiring careful navigation to maintain the benefits while managing the complications.</p>
<p>She might form entirely new relationships with characters introduced during play, expanding her Relationship Web and creating new support options.</p>

<h3 id="ai-assistance-1"><a class="header" href="#ai-assistance-1">AI Assistance</a></h3>
<p>Narrono includes an AI Character Generation Agent that can help you develop character ideas. The AI can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate trait options based on setting axes</li>
<li>Suggest appropriate assets</li>
<li>Recommend relationship types</li>
<li>Create integrated character concepts</li>
<li>Develop NPC groups for solo play</li>
</ul>
<p>To use the AI Character Generation Agent, provide your setting's axis choices and any specific character elements you already have in mind. The AI will analyze the setting and generate character options that fit within its framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: AI Character Generation</strong></p>
<p>A player might ask the AI: "Generate a character for 'Shadow Court' with a focus on uncovering supernatural secrets."</p>
<p>The AI would analyze the setting (Local/Hidden/Moderate/Hierarchical/Social) and generate a complete character with traits, assets, and relationship suggestions that fit both the setting and the player's concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that the AI is a tool to inspire and assist, not replace your creativity. Use its suggestions as starting points that you can modify, expand, or completely reimagine based on your interests.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-characters-in-context"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-characters-in-context">Conclusion: Characters in Context</a></h2>
<p>The character creation process in Narrono ensures that every character is deeply rooted in their setting. By deriving traits from setting axes, creating assets that reflect setting elements, and establishing relationships that make sense within the world, you create characters who feel like natural parts of their environment rather than generic archetypes dropped into a backdrop.</p>
<p>Remember these key principles as you create and develop your characters:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Shapes Characters:</strong> Your character's traits, assets, and relationships should all emerge naturally from the setting you've created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traits Drive Mechanics:</strong> Your character's traits directly influence which resolution methods work best in different situations, creating a mechanical connection between narrative and gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assets Create Opportunities:</strong> Assets aren't just mechanical bonuses—they're story elements that create both advantages and complications through their use and potential degradation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships Matter:</strong> The Relationship Web connects characters in meaningful ways, providing both support and tension that drives the narrative forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Characters Evolve:</strong> Through play, your character will change and develop as they interact with their setting and each other, creating a dynamic narrative that reflects their experiences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore the detailed mechanics of Narrono, showing how the Pool System, asset management, and relationship dynamics work together to create a rich, engaging gameplay experience.</p>

<p>In the previous chapters, you've learned the core concepts of Narrono: how to create a setting using the Five Axes framework, how to develop characters with traits and assets, and how to connect them through the Relationship Web. Now it's time to explore how these elements work together in play through the detailed mechanics of the game.</p>
<p>This chapter builds on the Pool System introduced in Chapter 1, showing how your character's traits, assets, and relationships influence your mechanical choices and create meaningful narrative moments. You'll learn advanced resolution techniques, strategic asset management, relationship dynamics, and how to handle special circumstances that arise during play.</p>
<p>Remember that in Narrono, mechanics aren't just about determining success or failure—they're tools for collaborative storytelling that create dramatic moments, interesting choices, and evolving narratives.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-resolution-mechanics"><a class="header" href="#advanced-resolution-mechanics">Advanced Resolution Mechanics</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-pool-system-revisited"><a class="header" href="#the-pool-system-revisited">The Pool System Revisited</a></h3>
<p>At its core, Narrono uses the Pool System for resolving significant actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Form a pool of three six-sided dice (3d6)</li>
<li>Roll all dice in your pool</li>
<li>Choose which result to use based on your method (Direct, Balanced, or Cautious)</li>
<li>Apply any asset or relationship effects</li>
<li>Determine the outcome level (Success, Partial Success, or Setback)</li>
</ol>
<p>While this basic framework remains consistent, the strategic depth comes from understanding when and how to use different methods, how to leverage assets and relationships, and how to interpret outcomes in narratively satisfying ways.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-method-selection"><a class="header" href="#strategic-method-selection">Strategic Method Selection</a></h3>
<p>Your choice of resolution method—Direct, Balanced, or Cautious—should be a strategic decision based on your character's traits, the situation, and your narrative goals.</p>
<h4 id="direct-method-highest-die"><a class="header" href="#direct-method-highest-die">Direct Method (Highest Die)</a></h4>
<p>The Direct method represents confident, straightforward action aligned with your character's traits. When you choose Direct, you're taking decisive action in an area where your character excels.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use Direct:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your traits strongly support the action</li>
<li>You need a high probability of full success</li>
<li>You can handle potential complications</li>
<li>The narrative impact of failure could be interesting</li>
<li>Asset or relationship support can mitigate the risk</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategic Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Direct offers the highest chance of Success (55.6%)</li>
<li>But also has a significant chance of Setback (25.9%)</li>
<li>Creates stronger narrative impact in both success and failure</li>
<li>Best used when you've positioned your assets and relationships to handle potential setbacks</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Direct Method in Action</strong></p>
<p>Mira needs to extract information from a rival noble at a court gathering. She chooses the Direct method because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her Origin as "Third Tier Noble of House Vayne" aligns perfectly with court interaction</li>
<li>She has her "Network of Informants" asset Fresh and ready to provide support</li>
<li>Her relationship with Elara is Strong and can help if complications arise</li>
<li>Even a Setback would create interesting narrative possibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Mira rolls her pool: [2, 4, 6]
Using Direct, she selects the highest die: 6
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Mira skillfully navigates the conversation, using her noble upbringing and subtle hints about information she already knows to extract the secrets she seeks. Her success strengthens her position in court but also creates a future complication as the rival begins to suspect her motives.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="balanced-method-middle-die"><a class="header" href="#balanced-method-middle-die">Balanced Method (Middle Die)</a></h4>
<p>The Balanced method represents measured, careful action where no single trait strongly applies. When you choose Balanced, you're taking a moderate approach that balances different aspects of your character.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use Balanced:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple traits have mixed relevance</li>
<li>Consistency is more important than peak success</li>
<li>You want to preserve assets and relationships</li>
<li>The situation requires careful navigation</li>
<li>You need to maintain multiple options</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategic Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Balanced offers the highest chance of Partial Success (44.4%)</li>
<li>Has equal chances of Success and Setback (27.8% each)</li>
<li>Creates moderate narrative impact</li>
<li>Best used when building toward larger goals where consistency matters</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Balanced Method in Action</strong></p>
<p>Karn needs to negotiate with a merchant from a rival clan. He chooses the Balanced method because:</p>
<ul>
<li>His Origin as "Exiled Hunter" doesn't directly help with negotiation</li>
<li>His Drive to "Reclaim Honor Through Proven Strength" isn't fully applicable</li>
<li>He wants to avoid risking his "Blood-Price Token" asset</li>
<li>The situation requires navigating unfamiliar social territory</li>
</ul>
<p>Karn rolls his pool: [1, 3, 5]
Using Balanced, he selects the middle die: 3
Result: Partial Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Karn manages to secure the trade agreement but at a higher cost than hoped. The merchant agrees to the terms but demands immediate payment rather than the credit Karn had hoped for. This creates a new complication—Karn must now find resources to fulfill his end of the bargain—but keeps the negotiation moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cautious-method-lowest-die"><a class="header" href="#cautious-method-lowest-die">Cautious Method (Lowest Die)</a></h4>
<p>The Cautious method represents careful handling of unfamiliar situations or actions that go against your character's traits. When you choose Cautious, you're acknowledging the challenge but taking a measured approach to minimize risk.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use Cautious:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acting against trait tendencies</li>
<li>Failure would be catastrophic</li>
<li>Assets or relationships are already strained</li>
<li>You need to preserve resources</li>
<li>The situation requires subtle action</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategic Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cautious has the highest chance of Setback (55.6%)</li>
<li>But also has a significant chance of Partial Success (44.4%)</li>
<li>Creates subtle narrative impact</li>
<li>Best used when control matters more than immediate success</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Cautious Method in Action</strong></p>
<p>Elara needs to infiltrate a noble's private study to examine suspicious documents. She chooses the Cautious method because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her Origin as "Royal Academy Graduate" doesn't prepare her for stealth</li>
<li>Her Goal to "Reform Medical Practices" doesn't align with breaking and entering</li>
<li>Failure could completely compromise her position at court</li>
<li>Her "Court Appointment" asset would be at serious risk if caught</li>
</ul>
<p>Elara rolls her pool: [2, 4, 6]
Using Cautious, she selects the lowest die: 2
Result: Setback</p>
<p>The GF describes how Elara's attempt to access the study is interrupted by a servant. However, using the Dynamic Outcome Interpretation framework, the GF transforms this failure into an opportunity: the servant reveals they've noticed strange behavior from their master and offers to help Elara if she can provide medical treatment for their sick child. This creates a new path forward despite the mechanical Setback.</p>

<h3 id="method-decision-framework"><a class="header" href="#method-decision-framework">Method Decision Framework</a></h3>
<p>When deciding which method to use, consider this decision framework:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD
    A[Consider Action] --&gt; B{Trait Alignment?}
    B --&gt;|Strong Alignment| C[Consider Direct]
    B --&gt;|Mixed Alignment| D[Consider Balanced]
    B --&gt;|Against Traits| E[Consider Cautious]
    
    C --&gt; F{Risk Assessment}
    D --&gt; F

    G --&gt; J[Highest Die]
    H --&gt; K[Middle Die]
    I --&gt; L[Lowest Die]
</code></pre>
<p>This framework helps you make strategic decisions based on your character's traits, the situation, and your narrative goals. Remember that there's rarely a single "correct" method—different approaches create different narrative possibilities and reflect different aspects of your character.</p>
<h3 id="complex-action-resolution"><a class="header" href="#complex-action-resolution">Complex Action Resolution</a></h3>
<p>Many situations involve multiple traits, assets, and relationships working together. In these complex actions, consider how different elements interact and support each other.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-trait-consideration"><a class="header" href="#multiple-trait-consideration">Multiple Trait Consideration</a></h4>
<p>When an action involves multiple traits with different levels of relevance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify which trait is most directly applicable</li>
<li>Consider how other traits might support or hinder the action</li>
<li>Choose your method based on the overall alignment</li>
<li>Describe how different aspects of your character come into play</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Multiple Trait Consideration</strong></p>
<p>Mira needs to convince the Harbor Council to support her family's trade proposal. This action involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her Origin as "Third Tier Noble" (strong alignment)</li>
<li>Her Drive to "Secure Power Through Secret Knowledge" (mixed alignment)</li>
<li>Her Goal to "Reshape House Influence in Harbor District" (strong alignment)</li>
</ul>
<p>With two traits strongly aligned and one with mixed relevance, Mira chooses the Direct method. She describes how she leverages both her noble status and her goal-driven focus on the Harbor District, while using her knowledge of secrets strategically rather than overtly.</p>
<p>Mira rolls her pool: [3, 3, 5]
Using Direct, she selects the highest die: 5
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Mira's presentation impresses the Council, securing their support while also revealing her growing influence in the district.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="asset-and-relationship-support"><a class="header" href="#asset-and-relationship-support">Asset and Relationship Support</a></h4>
<p>Assets and relationships can provide mechanical support for actions when they're relevant to the situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify which assets or relationships could help</li>
<li>Ensure they're in the appropriate state (Fresh/Strong)</li>
<li>Describe how they provide support</li>
<li>Add one die to your pool for each supporting element</li>
<li>Drop the lowest die before applying your method</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset and Relationship Support</strong></p>
<p>Karn needs to track a rival clan's hunting party through difficult terrain. He has:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Master-Crafted Hunting Bow" asset (Fresh)</li>
<li>Strong relationship with Thana, who has knowledge of the territory</li>
</ul>
<p>Both elements are relevant to tracking, so Karn adds two dice to his pool (one for each supporting element). He describes how the bow's craftsmanship helps him identify subtle signs of passage and how Thana's knowledge helps him anticipate the rival clan's movements.</p>
<p>Karn rolls his expanded pool: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
He drops the lowest two dice: [3, 4, 5]
Using Direct (as tracking aligns with his hunter background), he selects the highest die: 5
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Karn successfully tracks the hunting party to their camp, positioning himself perfectly for his next move.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="shared-story-pool-integration"><a class="header" href="#shared-story-pool-integration">Shared Story Pool Integration</a></h4>
<p>The Shared Story Pool provides additional options for complex actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a die from the Shared Story Pool</li>
<li>Describe how you're adding complexity, establishing relationships, creating opportunities, or enhancing your roll</li>
<li>Add the die to your pool or use it for its narrative effect</li>
<li>Consider how this affects the broader story</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Shared Story Pool Integration</strong></p>
<p>Elara is researching a mysterious illness affecting noble families. She decides to use the Shared Story Pool to create a new opportunity.</p>
<p>Elara takes a die from the Shared Story Pool and describes how she discovers an old medical text that mentions similar symptoms in a historical outbreak. This creates a new research direction and potential solution.</p>
<p>For her research roll, Elara now has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her basic pool: [2, 3, 6]</li>
<li>The die from the Shared Story Pool: [4]</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Balanced (as research involves both her medical training and supernatural investigation), she selects the middle die from her expanded pool: 4
Result: Partial Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Elara's research reveals a potential treatment but requires a rare ingredient that will be difficult to obtain, creating both a solution and a new challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dynamic-outcome-interpretation"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-outcome-interpretation">Dynamic Outcome Interpretation</a></h3>
<p>While dice determine the mechanical outcome of actions, the GF shapes how these outcomes manifest narratively, ensuring the story remains compelling regardless of the roll.</p>
<h4 id="enhanced-outcome-framework"><a class="header" href="#enhanced-outcome-framework">Enhanced Outcome Framework</a></h4>
<p>The Dynamic Outcome Interpretation framework provides guidelines for how outcomes manifest in the narrative:</p>
<h5 id="success-5-6-1"><a class="header" href="#success-5-6-1">Success (5-6)</a></h5>
<p><strong>Mechanical Result:</strong> Action succeeds<br />
<strong>GF's Role:</strong> Introduce future complications</p>
<ul>
<li>Create narrative hooks from the success</li>
<li>Plant seeds for future challenges</li>
<li>Establish new relationships or tensions</li>
<li>Show how success changes the setting</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="partial-success-3-4-1"><a class="header" href="#partial-success-3-4-1">Partial Success (3-4)</a></h5>
<p><strong>Mechanical Result:</strong> Action succeeds with cost<br />
<strong>GF's Role:</strong> Shape the nature of the cost</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust cost severity based on story needs</li>
<li>Create costs that drive character development</li>
<li>Use costs to introduce new story elements</li>
<li>Connect costs to existing complications</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="setback-1-2-1"><a class="header" href="#setback-1-2-1">Setback (1-2)</a></h5>
<p><strong>Mechanical Result:</strong> Action fails<br />
<strong>GF's Role:</strong> Transform failure into opportunity</p>
<ul>
<li>Create alternative paths forward</li>
<li>Reveal hidden information through failure</li>
<li>Introduce unexpected allies or resources</li>
<li>Use failure to highlight character growth opportunities</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Dynamic Outcome Interpretation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Success Example:</strong>
Mira successfully uncovers information about a rival family's secret dealings.</p>
<p>The GF honors this success but adds a future complication: "Your informants deliver detailed records of House Krell's smuggling operation. However, as you review the documents, you notice references to a mutual business partner who might now see your family as a threat if this information becomes public."</p>
<p><strong>Partial Success Example:</strong>
Karn partially succeeds in convincing a clan elder to support his cause.</p>
<p>The GF shapes the cost: "The elder agrees to speak on your behalf at the council, but demands you first complete a dangerous hunt to prove your worth to the clan. This not only delays your plans but puts you at personal risk."</p>
<p><strong>Setback Example:</strong>
Elara fails to create an effective remedy for a patient's condition.</p>
<p>The GF transforms this failure: "Your treatment doesn't work as expected, but the unusual reaction reveals that the patient's illness isn't natural—there are traces of a rare poison. This gives you a new direction for investigation and treatment."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-compensation-principle"><a class="header" href="#the-compensation-principle">The Compensation Principle</a></h4>
<p>When dice create extreme results (multiple successes or failures in a row), the GF should apply the Compensation Principle to maintain narrative momentum:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledge the mechanical outcome</li>
<li>Consider the narrative momentum</li>
<li>Introduce balancing elements</li>
<li>Create new opportunities</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Compensation Principle in Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>After Multiple Successes:</strong>
Mira has succeeded at three consecutive social challenges, dominating court politics.</p>
<p>The GF applies compensation: "Your political maneuvering has been masterful, securing your family's position. However, your rising influence has attracted the attention of the Royal Spymaster, who begins to investigate your sources of information. Your success creates a new, more dangerous opponent."</p>
<p><strong>After Multiple Setbacks:</strong>
Karn has failed three consecutive attempts to navigate tribal politics.</p>
<p>The GF applies compensation: "Your frustrating failures in the council have revealed something important—there's an underlying pattern to the opposition. You realize that someone is working behind the scenes to block all border clan initiatives. This knowledge gives you a new target for your efforts."</p>

<h2 id="asset-management-system"><a class="header" href="#asset-management-system">Asset Management System</a></h2>
<p>Assets represent your character's equipment, resources, special abilities, and advantages. Managing these assets strategically creates both mechanical benefits and narrative opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-asset-use"><a class="header" href="#strategic-asset-use">Strategic Asset Use</a></h3>
<p>Assets exist in three states that reflect their condition and availability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh:</strong> Providing full benefits and support</li>
<li><strong>Degraded:</strong> Creating complications but still usable</li>
<li><strong>Depleted:</strong> Temporarily unusable until restored</li>
</ul>
<p>Your strategic decisions about when and how to use assets, when to risk degradation, and how to manage recovery create meaningful choices throughout play.</p>
<h4 id="when-to-use-fresh-assets"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-fresh-assets">When to Use Fresh Assets</a></h4>
<p>Fresh assets provide their full benefits without complications. Consider using them when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The action is critically important</li>
<li>You need the highest probability of success</li>
<li>The narrative justifies their use</li>
<li>You have clear recovery options if they degrade</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Strategic Fresh Asset Use</strong></p>
<p>Mira needs to gain access to a restricted noble gathering. She decides to use her "Ancestral Signet Ring" asset (currently Fresh) to support her attempt.</p>
<p>She describes how the ring's family crest grants her legitimate access to the event. This adds a die to her pool, increasing her chances of success in this critical moment.</p>
<p>Mira rolls her expanded pool: [2, 3, 4, 5]
She drops the lowest die: [3, 4, 5]
Using Direct (as social navigation aligns with her noble background), she selects the highest die: 5
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how the guards recognize the ancient symbol of House Vayne and admit Mira without question, positioning her perfectly for her next move.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="risk-assessment-1"><a class="header" href="#risk-assessment-1">Risk Assessment</a></h4>
<p>When considering whether to risk an asset's degradation for additional benefits, assess:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Current State</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh assets can be degraded to Degraded</li>
<li>Degraded assets can be degraded to Depleted</li>
<li>Depleted assets cannot be used until restored</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovery Opportunities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Known restoration methods</li>
<li>Upcoming story possibilities</li>
<li>Group resource availability</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term utility</li>
<li>Long-term importance</li>
<li>Narrative significance</li>
<li>Connection implications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset Risk Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Karn is tracking a dangerous beast and has already used his "Master-Crafted Hunting Bow" asset (currently Degraded) to support his initial tracking roll. He's now faced with a difficult shot to bring down the creature.</p>
<p>He considers risking further degradation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current State: Degraded (would become Depleted if risked)</li>
<li>Recovery Opportunities: Limited in the wilderness</li>
<li>Strategic Value: High for current situation, but also needed later</li>
</ul>
<p>Weighing these factors, Karn decides the risk is worth it. He describes pushing his bow to its limits, risking damage to make the perfect shot.</p>
<p>Karn chooses to reroll his lowest die, describing how he's pushing his bow beyond its current capabilities.
Original roll: [1, 3, 5]
Rerolled die: [4]
New pool: [3, 4, 5]
Using Direct, he selects the highest die: 5
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Karn makes a perfect shot, bringing down the beast. However, the strain causes his bow's string to snap and a crack to form in the wood. The asset is now Depleted and unusable until repaired.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="asset-recovery-methods"><a class="header" href="#asset-recovery-methods">Asset Recovery Methods</a></h4>
<p>Depleted assets require narrative resolution to restore. Recovery methods include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrative Opportunities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finding appropriate resources</li>
<li>Meeting specialists who can help</li>
<li>Creating time for repair or restoration</li>
<li>Discovering alternative solutions</li>

<li>Calling on connections for help</li>
<li>Trading favors for assistance</li>
<li>Strengthening bonds through need</li>
<li>Creating new relationships</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Karn needs to restore his Depleted "Master-Crafted Hunting Bow" before the upcoming clan hunt. He identifies several recovery options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Narrative Opportunity: Seek out the forest hermit known for bowcraft</li>
<li>Resource Allocation: Trade valuable pelts for repair materials</li>
<li>Relationship Support: Ask Thana to introduce him to her clan's weaponsmith</li>
</ol>
<p>Karn chooses to pursue the relationship support option, strengthening his connection with Thana while solving his practical problem.</p>
<p>The GF describes a scene where Karn approaches Thana for help, creating both a character moment and a practical solution. Thana's introduction to the weaponsmith not only restores Karn's bow to Fresh status but also establishes a new NPC connection that might be valuable in the future.</p>

<h3 id="asset-state-tracking"><a class="header" href="#asset-state-tracking">Asset State Tracking</a></h3>
<p>Tracking asset states creates both mechanical effects and narrative opportunities:</p>
<h4 id="fresh-assets"><a class="header" href="#fresh-assets">Fresh Assets</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide full mechanical benefits</li>
<li>Can be used for support (+1 die)</li>

<h4 id="depleted-assets"><a class="header" href="#depleted-assets">Depleted Assets</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily unusable</li>
<li>Require narrative resolution to restore</li>
<li>Create recovery story opportunities</li>
<li>Force adaptation and alternative approaches</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset State Narrative Integration</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fresh → Degraded:</strong>
Mira's "Network of Informants" becomes Degraded after she pushes them for particularly sensitive information. The GF describes how some informants become nervous and less reliable, creating both mechanical limitations (less effective information gathering) and narrative opportunities (how will Mira reassure her sources?).</p>
<p><strong>Degraded → Depleted:</strong>
Mira later risks her already Degraded network to uncover information about a royal scandal. The network becomes Depleted as key informants are discovered and removed from their positions. This creates both a mechanical limitation (network unusable) and a significant story opportunity (how will Mira rebuild her information sources?).</p>
<p><strong>Depleted → Fresh:</strong>
Through careful narrative resolution—establishing new contacts, creating cover identities, and leveraging her relationship with Lord Darius—Mira eventually restores her network to Fresh status. This recovery process created multiple engaging scenes and strengthened her character connections.</p>

Elara's "Physician's Kit" evolves as she incorporates new treatments and techniques. After successfully treating several unusual cases, she adds specialized tools and remedies, expanding the asset's capabilities to include treatment of supernatural ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Modification Based on Events:</strong>
After a dramatic confrontation with a rival noble who attempted to steal her research, Elara modifies her "Hidden Laboratory" asset to include new security measures and a secret escape route, reflecting the narrative events in mechanical changes.</p>
<p><strong>Setting-Influenced Changes:</strong>
As the "Shadow Court" setting evolves and supernatural elements become more prominent (shifting on the Supernatural Level axis), Elara's "Court Appointment" asset evolves to include official recognition of her expertise in unusual cases, reflecting the setting's changing nature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Support</strong></p>
<p>Mira needs to navigate a dangerous political situation. She calls on her Strong relationship with Elara for support.</p>
<p>She describes how Elara's medical knowledge helps her identify signs of poison at a noble gathering, warning her away from compromised food and drink. This adds a die to her pool, increasing her chances of success.</p>
<p>Mira rolls her expanded pool: [1, 3, 4, 6]
She drops the lowest die: [3, 4, 6]
Using Direct (as political navigation aligns with her noble background), she selects the highest die: 6
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how Mira successfully navigates the gathering, avoiding the poison while gathering valuable information. Her relationship with Elara has provided both practical help and strengthened their narrative bond.</p>

<h3 id="relationship-state-changes"><a class="header" href="#relationship-state-changes">Relationship State Changes</a></h3>
<p>Like assets, relationships exist in multiple states that can change through play:</p>
<h4 id="strong-relationships"><a class="header" href="#strong-relationships">Strong Relationships</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide full support benefits</li>
<li>Create narrative opportunities</li>
<li>Enable special actions</li>
<li>Can be strained for additional benefits</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strained-relationships"><a class="header" href="#strained-relationships">Strained Relationships</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide limited benefits</li>
<li>Create narrative tension</li>
<li>Require careful management</li>
<li>Can be broken through further strain</li>

<h4 id="broken-relationships"><a class="header" href="#broken-relationships">Broken Relationships</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily unusable</li>

<h4 id="transformed-relationships"><a class="header" href="#transformed-relationships">Transformed Relationships</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Changed into new relationship types</li>
<li>Reflect significant narrative development</li>
<li>Create new mechanical options</li>
<li>Demonstrate character evolution</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship State Changes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong → Strained:</strong>
Karn's "Blood Brothers" relationship with Thana becomes Strained when he pursues a course of action that endangers her clan. The GF describes how Thana's loyalty is tested, creating both mechanical limitations (reduced effectiveness of support) and narrative tension (how will they resolve this conflict?).</p>
<p><strong>Strained → Broken:</strong>
If Karn later betrays Thana's trust completely, perhaps by revealing clan secrets to outsiders, the relationship could become Broken. This creates both a mechanical limitation (relationship unusable) and a major story opportunity (can this bond ever be repaired?).</p>
<p><strong>Broken → Transformed:</strong>
Through significant narrative resolution—perhaps a life-threatening situation where Karn sacrifices his safety for Thana's clan—the relationship might be Transformed from "Blood Brothers" to "Clan Champion," reflecting how their bond has evolved through conflict and resolution.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Web Dynamics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Group Interaction:</strong>
Mira, Elara, and Lord Darius all have Strong relationships with each other, creating a powerful support network. When facing a major political challenge, all three characters can coordinate their efforts, with each relationship providing different benefits based on their nature.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Relationships:</strong>
Karn has a Strong relationship with Thana (Blood Brothers) but a Strained relationship with Lord Darius (Uneasy Alliance). When Thana and Darius come into conflict over border territory, Karn faces divided loyalties that create both mechanical challenges (which relationship to leverage?) and character development opportunities (how to resolve this conflict?).</p>
<p><strong>Web Evolution:</strong>
As the "Shadow Court" setting evolves through play, perhaps with increasing supernatural elements or shifting power dynamics, the entire Relationship Web adapts. New connections form based on emerging threats, existing relationships transform to reflect changing circumstances, and the overall network shifts to accommodate the evolving narrative.</p>

<h2 id="special-circumstances-1"><a class="header" href="#special-circumstances-1">Special Circumstances</a></h2>
<p>Beyond the standard resolution mechanics, several special circumstances create unique challenges and opportunities during play.</p>
<h3 id="favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions"><a class="header" href="#favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</a></h3>
<p>External circumstances can create advantages or disadvantages beyond your character's traits and assets:</p>
<h4 id="favorable-conditions-1"><a class="header" href="#favorable-conditions-1">Favorable Conditions</a></h4>
<p>When circumstances clearly advantage you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add one die to pool</li>

<li>May involve environmental benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>When circumstances clearly hinder you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove one die from pool</li>
<li>Must use remaining dice</li>
<li>Describe hindrance in setting terms</li>
<li>May involve environmental challenges</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Favorable Conditions:</strong>
Mira attempts to gather information at a masquerade ball, where anonymity creates a favorable condition for her inquiries. This adds a die to her pool, increasing her chances of success.</p>
<p>Mira rolls her expanded pool: [2, 3, 5, 6]
She drops the lowest die: [3, 5, 6]
Using Direct, she selects the highest die: 6
Result: Success</p>
<p><strong>Unfavorable Conditions:</strong>
Karn attempts to track prey during a heavy rainstorm, which creates unfavorable conditions by washing away signs of passage. This removes a die from his pool, decreasing his chances of success.</p>
<p>Karn rolls his reduced pool: [2, 5]
Using Direct, he selects the highest die: 5
Result: Success (but with fewer options than normal)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="extended-challenges"><a class="header" href="#extended-challenges">Extended Challenges</a></h3>
<p>Some significant actions require multiple steps or sustained effort to complete:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break the challenge into connected steps</li>
<li>Establish the required number of successes</li>
<li>Determine the consequence of setbacks</li>
<li>Track progress toward completion</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Extended Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Elara attempts to develop a cure for a mysterious illness affecting multiple noble houses. The GF establishes this as an extended challenge requiring three successes to complete, with setbacks creating additional complications rather than resetting progress.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Research</strong>
Elara rolls for research: [1, 3, 6]
Using Direct (as medical research aligns with her training), she selects the highest die: 6
Result: Success (1 of 3 required)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Experimentation</strong>
Elara rolls for experimentation: [2, 2, 4]
Using Balanced (as this involves both medical knowledge and intuition), she selects the middle die: 2
Result: Setback</p>
<p>The GF describes how Elara's experiment fails, creating a complication: one of her samples is contaminated, and she develops mild symptoms herself. This creates urgency but doesn't reset her progress.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Revised Experimentation</strong>
Elara rolls again: [3, 4, 5]
Using Balanced, she selects the middle die: 4
Result: Partial Success (2 of 3 required)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Final Synthesis</strong>
Elara rolls for the final step: [2, 5, 6]
Using Direct, she selects the highest die: 6
Result: Success (3 of 3 required)</p>
<p>The GF describes how Elara successfully develops the cure, incorporating the insights gained from her own symptoms into the final formula. The extended challenge created a narrative arc with rising tension and a satisfying resolution.</p>

<h3 id="group-actions"><a class="header" href="#group-actions">Group Actions</a></h3>
<p>When multiple characters work together toward a shared goal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a primary actor</li>
<li>Determine how others provide support</li>
<li>Add dice for relevant supporting actions</li>
<li>Apply the primary actor's method</li>
<li>Describe how the group coordinates</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Group Action</strong></p>
<p>Mira, Karn, and Elara work together to infiltrate a rival noble's estate. They establish Mira as the primary actor (using her social skills to gain entry), with Karn providing security assessment and Elara creating a medical emergency as a distraction.</p>
<p>Mira's base pool: [2, 3, 5]
Support from Karn: [6]
Support from Elara: [4]
Combined pool: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
<p>Dropping the lowest two dice: [4, 5, 6]
Using Direct (as social manipulation aligns with Mira's traits), she selects the highest die: 6
Result: Success</p>
<p>The GF describes how the group's coordinated effort succeeds brilliantly: Elara's medical distraction draws guards away, Karn's security assessment identifies the perfect entry point, and Mira's social skills convince the remaining staff that they have legitimate business at the estate.</p>

<h4 id="asset-state-manipulation"><a class="header" href="#asset-state-manipulation">Asset State Manipulation</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Expedite recovery of depleted assets when needed</li>
<li>Create new degradation risks during success</li>

<li>Use asset states to pace challenges</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="relationship-state-adjustments"><a class="header" href="#relationship-state-adjustments">Relationship State Adjustments</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen bonds after shared challenges</li>
<li>Create strain during periods of success</li>
<li>Offer reconciliation opportunities during setbacks</li>
<li>Use relationship dynamics to drive character development</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Dynamic Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supporting Struggling Players:</strong>
After Karn experiences multiple setbacks trying to navigate clan politics, the GF expedites the recovery of his Depleted "Blood-Price Token" asset. The GF describes how a sympathetic elder recognizes Karn's sincere efforts despite his failures and offers to restore the token's significance through a simple ceremony rather than requiring a lengthy quest.</p>
<p><strong>Challenging Successful Players:</strong>
After Mira experiences multiple successes in court politics, the GF introduces a new risk to her Fresh "Network of Informants" asset. The GF describes how Mira's rising influence has made her informants more visible, creating a risk of exposure that she must manage carefully to avoid degradation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Character Development Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trait Evolution:</strong>
As Mira's influence in court grows, her Origin evolves from "Third Tier Noble of House Vayne" to "Rising Power in House Vayne," reflecting her changing status. This evolution expands her mechanical options in social situations, allowing her to interact with higher-tier nobles as an equal rather than a subordinate.</p>
<p><strong>Asset Expansion:</strong>
Through play, Mira acquires a new asset: "Court Spy Network," which complements her existing "Network of Informants" but focuses specifically on court politics. This expansion gives her more specialized options for gathering information in different contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Growth:</strong>
Mira's relationship with Lord Darius transforms from "Debt and Obligation" to "Political Alliance" as they work together to address court corruption. This transformation changes the nature of their mechanical support, focusing more on coordinated political action rather than personal favors.</p>

<p><strong>Supernatural Level Change:</strong>
As supernatural elements become more prominent in "Shadow Court," moving from Hidden to Emerging on the Supernatural Level axis, new asset categories become available. Elara's medical research can now openly incorporate supernatural elements, creating new mechanical options for healing and investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Social Structure Transformation:</strong>
As the rigid Hierarchical structure of "Shadow Court" begins to show cracks, moving toward a more Merit-based system, the implications of Origin traits change. Karn's status as an outsider becomes less of a hindrance, allowing him to leverage his skills more effectively in social situations.</p>

<p>The detailed mechanics of Narrono aren't just rules for determining success or failure—they're tools for collaborative storytelling that create dramatic moments, interesting choices, and evolving narratives. By understanding how traits, assets, relationships, and resolution methods work together, you can create a rich, engaging gameplay experience that serves your group's unique story.</p>
<p>Remember these key principles as you apply the mechanics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Method Choice Matters:</strong> Your choice of resolution method (Direct, Balanced, or Cautious) should reflect both your character's traits and your narrative goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assets Create Opportunities:</strong> Assets aren't just mechanical bonuses—they're story elements that create both advantages and complications through their use and potential degradation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships Drive Narrative:</strong> The Relationship Web connects characters in meaningful ways, providing both support and tension that drives the narrative forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outcomes Shape Story:</strong> Through Dynamic Outcome Interpretation and the Compensation Principle, even mechanical setbacks can create compelling narrative moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Defines Options:</strong> Your setting's position on the Five Axes directly influences what mechanical choices make sense and how they function in play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolution Creates Arcs:</strong> As characters, assets, relationships, and settings evolve through play, the mechanics adapt to support satisfying long-term narrative arcs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore the Game Facilitator's role in Narrono, showing how to create engaging scenes, manage narrative flow, and apply the mechanics effectively to create a satisfying gameplay experience for everyone at the table.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-5-game-facilitator"><a class="header" href="#chapter-5-game-facilitator">Chapter 5: Game Facilitator</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-art-of-facilitation"><a class="header" href="#the-art-of-facilitation">The Art of Facilitation</a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapters, you've learned the core concepts of Narrono: how to create a setting using the Five Axes framework, how to develop characters with traits and assets, how to connect them through the Relationship Web, and how the detailed mechanics work together to create meaningful narrative moments. Now it's time to explore the role that brings all these elements together: the Game Facilitator.</p>
<p>As a Game Facilitator (GF), you're not just a referee or storyteller—you're a collaborative partner in creating a dynamic, evolving narrative with your players. Your role is to facilitate the story that emerges from the intersection of setting elements, character choices, mechanical outcomes, and group dynamics. This chapter will show you how to create engaging scenes, manage narrative flow, and apply the mechanics effectively to create a satisfying gameplay experience for everyone at the table.</p>
<p>Remember that in Narrono, facilitation isn't about controlling the story—it's about creating the conditions for a compelling collaborative narrative to emerge through play.</p>
<h2 id="core-gf-responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#core-gf-responsibilities">Core GF Responsibilities</a></h2>
<h3 id="setting-as-foundation"><a class="header" href="#setting-as-foundation">Setting as Foundation</a></h3>
<p>Every element of play builds from your setting choices. As GF, you're responsible for bringing the setting to life and showing how it shapes the characters' experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpret mechanics through the setting lens</li>
<li>Connect traits to setting elements</li>
<li>Ensure assets match setting constraints</li>
<li>Create appropriate complications</li>
<li>Show how the Five Axes manifest in daily life</li>
</ul>
<p>The setting isn't just backdrop—it's an active participant in the story. When describing scenes, always reference relevant axis elements, show setting constraints, establish context, and present setting-specific details that make the world feel alive and consistent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Setting as Foundation</strong></p>
<p>In a Merit-based, Advanced Tech setting with Social Conflict, the GF describes:</p>
<p>"The corporate lobby's security scanners hum quietly as you enter. Your degraded Access Card flickers, struggling with the latest encryption update—a common problem for those without premium maintenance contracts. The head of HR, who rose from data entry to executive through demonstrated skill rather than connections, reviews applicant files nearby. She glances at you with professional curiosity, perhaps recognizing you from your mentor's social media posts."</p>
<p>This description incorporates Merit-based elements (advancement through skill), Advanced Tech (security scanners, encryption), and Social Conflict (professional relationships, subtle recognition), making the setting tangible and immediate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="story-through-mechanics"><a class="header" href="#story-through-mechanics">Story Through Mechanics</a></h3>
<p>In Narrono, every mechanical choice represents a narrative decision. As GF, you help players understand how their mechanical choices reflect their characters' approaches and personalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct rolls represent embracing a trait</li>
<li>Balanced rolls show careful navigation between traits</li>
<li>Cautious rolls indicate acting against natural tendencies</li>
<li>Asset usage reveals character priorities</li>
<li>Relationship involvement shows character connections</li>
</ul>
<p>When players make mechanical choices, help them see the narrative implications. When they choose Direct method for a social challenge, it's not just about using the highest die—it's about their character confidently leveraging their noble upbringing or street smarts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Story Through Mechanics</strong></p>
<p>Player: "I want to convince the guard to let us through. I'll use my 'Former Guard Captain' Origin and roll Direct."</p>
<p>GF: "As you approach, you stand tall with the unmistakable bearing of command. Your words carry the weight of someone used to giving orders, and you seamlessly incorporate guard terminology that marks you as one of their own. The guard straightens instinctively in response."</p>
<p>After the roll (Success - 6):</p>
<p>GF: "The guard not only lets you pass but offers a respectful nod. However, his supervisor notices this special treatment from across the courtyard and makes a note—your success has created a ripple that might return later."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dynamic-outcome-interpretation-1"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-outcome-interpretation-1">Dynamic Outcome Interpretation</a></h3>
<p>While dice determine the mechanical outcome of actions, as GF you shape how these outcomes manifest narratively, ensuring the story remains compelling regardless of the roll. This is one of your most important responsibilities. For detailed guidance and examples, see the Dynamic Outcome Interpretation Matrix in the GF Tools reference section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor the mechanical result</li>
<li>Shape the narrative consequences</li>
<li>Create new opportunities</li>
<li>Maintain setting consistency</li>
<li>Support character development</li>
<li>Balance challenge and progress</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dynamic Outcome Interpretation framework (detailed in Chapter 4) provides guidelines for how outcomes manifest in the narrative:</p>
<h4 id="success-5-6-2"><a class="header" href="#success-5-6-2">Success (5-6)</a></h4>
<p><strong>Mechanical Result:</strong> Action succeeds<br />
<strong>Your Role:</strong> Introduce future complications</p>
<ul>
<li>Create narrative hooks from the success</li>
<li>Plant seeds for future challenges</li>
<li>Establish new relationships or tensions</li>
<li>Show how success changes the setting</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="partial-success-3-4-2"><a class="header" href="#partial-success-3-4-2">Partial Success (3-4)</a></h4>
<p><strong>Mechanical Result:</strong> Action succeeds with cost<br />
<strong>Your Role:</strong> Shape the nature of the cost</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust cost severity based on story needs</li>
<li>Create costs that drive character development</li>
<li>Use costs to introduce new story elements</li>
<li>Connect costs to existing complications</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="setback-1-2-2"><a class="header" href="#setback-1-2-2">Setback (1-2)</a></h4>
<p><strong>Mechanical Result:</strong> Action fails<br />
<strong>Your Role:</strong> Transform failure into opportunity</p>
<ul>
<li>Create alternative paths forward</li>
<li>Reveal hidden information through failure</li>
<li>Introduce unexpected allies or resources</li>
<li>Use failure to highlight character growth opportunities</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Dynamic Outcome Interpretation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Success Example:</strong>
Player rolls a 6 when investigating a noble's suspicious activities.</p>
<p>GF: "Your careful observation reveals clear evidence of the noble's smuggling operation. You identify key warehouses, contacts, and even shipment schedules. However, as you're documenting these details, you notice a familiar symbol in the records—one connected to your mentor. This success has uncovered a thread that leads uncomfortably close to home."</p>
<p><strong>Partial Success Example:</strong>
Player rolls a 3 when attempting to navigate treacherous mountain terrain.</p>
<p>GF: "You find a path through the mountains, but the journey takes longer than expected. As night falls, you're forced to make camp in a narrow pass. The delay means you'll arrive after the meeting has started, and the difficult terrain has degraded your 'Survival Gear' asset—the straps are wearing thin and will need repair before your return journey."</p>
<p><strong>Setback Example:</strong>
Player rolls a 2 when trying to decode an encrypted message.</p>
<p>GF: "Despite your best efforts, the encryption remains unbroken. However, your failed attempt reveals something interesting—this isn't standard corporate encryption. The patterns suggest military-grade security, which raises new questions about who sent this message and why they needed such extreme protection. This failure has revealed a deeper mystery."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-compensation-principle-1"><a class="header" href="#the-compensation-principle-1">The Compensation Principle</a></h3>
<p>When dice create extreme results (multiple successes or failures in a row), apply the Compensation Principle to maintain narrative momentum. For step-by-step guidance on implementing this principle effectively, see the Compensation Principle Flowchart in the GF Tools reference section.</p>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledge the mechanical outcome</li>
<li>Consider the narrative momentum</li>
<li>Introduce balancing elements</li>
<li>Create new opportunities</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn't negate the dice results but ensures the story remains engaging regardless of luck.</p>
<h4 id="after-multiple-successes"><a class="header" href="#after-multiple-successes">After Multiple Successes</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Introduce longer-term complications</li>
<li>Create tension between different successes</li>
<li>Show unintended consequences of victory</li>
<li>Raise stakes for future challenges</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="after-multiple-setbacks"><a class="header" href="#after-multiple-setbacks">After Multiple Setbacks</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Reveal new information through failure</li>
<li>Create unexpected advantages</li>
<li>Introduce helpful NPCs or resources</li>
<li>Show character growth through adversity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Compensation Principle</strong></p>
<p><strong>After Multiple Successes:</strong>
A player has succeeded at three consecutive social challenges, dominating court politics.</p>
<p>GF: "Your political maneuvering has been masterful, securing your family's position and outmaneuvering several rivals. However, your rising influence has attracted the attention of the Royal Spymaster, who begins to investigate your sources of information. Your success creates a new, more dangerous opponent who operates in shadows rather than the familiar arena of court politics."</p>
<p><strong>After Multiple Setbacks:</strong>
A player has failed three consecutive attempts to navigate tribal politics.</p>
<p>GF: "As you leave the council meeting after another frustrating rejection, you notice a pattern in the elder's objections. They're not dismissing your ideas directly—they're responding negatively to specific phrases you're using. This suggests someone has been working behind the scenes, poisoning the elders against border clan initiatives. This knowledge gives you a new target for your efforts and a different approach to consider."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asset-state-manipulation-1"><a class="header" href="#asset-state-manipulation-1">Asset State Manipulation</a></h3>
<p>Use asset states as a balancing tool for narrative flow. For tools to help maintain mechanical balance while preserving narrative excitement, see the Balance Tracker in the GF Tools reference section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expedite recovery of depleted assets when needed</li>
<li>Create new degradation risks during success</li>
<li>Offer temporary asset benefits during setbacks</li>
<li>Use asset states to pace challenges</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Asset State Manipulation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supporting Struggling Players:</strong>
A character with a Depleted "Security Clearance" asset is struggling to make progress.</p>
<p>GF: "While your clearance is technically revoked, you notice the security system is undergoing maintenance. This creates a temporary window where your old credentials might work one more time before becoming permanently invalid."</p>
<p><strong>Challenging Successful Players:</strong>
A character with a Fresh "Trade Network" asset has been consistently successful.</p>
<p>GF: "Your trade network secures another favorable deal, but rumors start spreading about how you achieve such exceptional terms. Your network remains effective but is showing signs of strain as key contacts become concerned about their association with you."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Three-Layer Approach</strong></p>
<p><strong>Setting Layer:</strong>
"The 87th floor executive suite of Helix Corporation gleams with polished surfaces and subtle displays of wealth. Security cameras with advanced facial recognition sweep the corridors at regular intervals. The quarterly board meeting has drawn most executives away, leaving a skeleton crew of assistants and security personnel. Recent protests against Helix's new neural implant have put security on higher alert, but also distracted them from routine monitoring."</p>
<p><strong>Character Layer:</strong>
"Your 'Corporate Analyst' Origin gives you legitimate reason to be in the building, but your Drive to 'Expose Corporate Corruption' puts you at risk if discovered. Your 'Executive Access Badge' asset is Fresh but will trigger alerts if used in restricted areas. Your relationship with Maya, a disgruntled Helix programmer, gives you inside knowledge of security protocols. The data you seek could advance your Goal of 'Bringing Down the CEO' but also puts Maya at risk."</p>
<p><strong>Options Layer:</strong>
"You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your Corporate Analyst credentials directly to request the files through official channels (Direct method, leveraging your Origin)</li>
<li>Find a workstation and use your technical skills to access the network (Balanced method, moderate risk)</li>
<li>Convince a distracted assistant that you're conducting an internal audit (Cautious method, going against your usual direct approach)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Fresh Executive Access Badge could get you into the executive wing, but using it there would create a permanent record of your presence. Your relationship with Maya could provide remote assistance, but involving her further strains your already Strained relationship."</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting-common-issues"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting-common-issues">Troubleshooting Common Issues</a></h3>
<p>Even the best-planned sessions sometimes encounter challenges. Here are strategies for addressing common issues:</p>
<h4 id="when-players-hesitate"><a class="header" href="#when-players-hesitate">When Players Hesitate</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Reference setting elements to provide context</li>
<li>Show clear asset opportunities</li>
<li>Connect the situation to character goals</li>
<li>Present immediate stakes to create urgency</li>
<li>Offer a clear starting point for action</li>
</ul>
<p>For tools to evaluate and improve player engagement, see the Player Engagement Assessment in the GF Tools reference section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Addressing Hesitation</strong></p>
<p>GF: "As you consider your options, you notice the guard rotation is about to change. Your 'Security Systems' asset would be particularly useful now, and successfully accessing the records would provide information directly related to your goal of exposing the conspiracy. If you don't act within the next few minutes, the opportunity will pass as the new guards arrive."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="when-scenes-stall"><a class="header" href="#when-scenes-stall">When Scenes Stall</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a setting complication</li>
<li>Bring in a relationship connection</li>
<li>Escalate existing tension</li>
<li>Add time pressure</li>
<li>Shift focus to a different aspect of the scene</li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive guide to identifying and addressing scene stagnation, see the Scene Stagnation Checklist in the GF Tools reference section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Revitalizing a Stalled Scene</strong></p>
<p>GF: "While you're discussing options, a messenger arrives with an urgent notice—the council meeting has been moved up to tomorrow morning. This gives you limited time to prepare your case. Additionally, you recognize the messenger as someone connected to Lord Darius, suggesting he might have influenced this schedule change."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="when-choices-feel-meaningless"><a class="header" href="#when-choices-feel-meaningless">When Choices Feel Meaningless</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Show setting implications for different options</li>
<li>Connect choices to character traits</li>
<li>Add asset considerations to decisions</li>
<li>Reveal hidden stakes</li>
<li>Create different risk/reward profiles for options</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Making Choices Meaningful</strong></p>
<p>GF: "You have two potential approaches to the archives. The main entrance would require social finesse, playing to your noble background but risking recognition. The service entrance would require stealth, which isn't your strength, but would keep your presence completely secret. Your 'Noble Signet' asset would be particularly effective at the main entrance, while the service route would avoid putting your already Strained relationship with the archivist at further risk."</p>

<li><strong>Mechanics as Narrative:</strong> Help players see how mechanical choices reflect character approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Interpretation:</strong> Shape outcomes to create engaging narrative while honoring dice results.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Balance:</strong> Use the Compensation Principle and asset state manipulation to maintain momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Character Development:</strong> Create opportunities for meaningful character growth and evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Group Engagement:</strong> Ensure all players remain invested and involved in the unfolding story.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore optional rules and variants that can further customize your Narrono experience to suit your group's specific interests and preferences.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-6-optional-rules"><a class="header" href="#chapter-6-optional-rules">Chapter 6: Optional Rules</a></h1>
<h2 id="expanding-your-game"><a class="header" href="#expanding-your-game">Expanding Your Game</a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapters, you've learned the core concepts of Narrono: how to create a setting using the Five Axes framework, how to develop characters with traits and assets, how to connect them through the Relationship Web, and how the detailed mechanics work together to create meaningful narrative moments. You've also explored the role of the Game Facilitator in bringing these elements together. Now it's time to consider how you might customize and expand your game experience with optional rules.</p>
<p>This chapter presents modular enhancements that you can add to your Narrono games. These options are designed to maintain the core system's integrity while providing additional mechanical depth for specific play styles, genres, or campaign types. You can adopt these rules individually or in packages, depending on your group's preferences and the needs of your particular setting.</p>
<p>Remember that these options are entirely optional—the core system is complete as presented in the previous chapters. These additional rules simply offer ways to tailor the experience to your group's specific interests and play style.</p>
<h2 id="character-evolution-1"><a class="header" href="#character-evolution-1">Character Evolution</a></h2>
<p>The core rules provide a solid framework for character development through trait refinement, asset acquisition, and relationship evolution. These optional rules expand those possibilities with more detailed systems for character growth over extended campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="trait-expansion"><a class="header" href="#trait-expansion">Trait Expansion</a></h3>
<p>Characters can develop new aspects of existing traits, adding nuance and specialization without completely changing their fundamental nature:</p>
<h4 id="origin-enhancement"><a class="header" href="#origin-enhancement">Origin Enhancement</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Add new relationships within original context</li>
<li>Develop specialized knowledge or authority</li>
<li>Create sub-groups or factions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Origin Enhancement</strong></p>
<p>Karn's Origin as a "Mountain Clan Warrior" might develop into "Voice of the Eastern Peaks" after successfully representing his clan in negotiations with neighboring tribes. This enhancement maintains his fundamental identity while adding new social dimensions that reflect his experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="drive-refinement"><a class="header" href="#drive-refinement">Drive Refinement</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Specify particular methods or approaches</li>
<li>Add secondary objectives</li>
<li>Connect to new conflict types</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Drive Refinement</strong></p>
<p>Mira's Drive to "Control Trade Routes" might refine to "Master of the Silk Road" after focusing her efforts on a specific trading path. This refinement narrows her focus but deepens her connection to particular allies, enemies, and resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="goal-development"><a class="header" href="#goal-development">Goal Development</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Shift between power scales</li>
<li>Add intermediate objectives</li>
<li>Create parallel pursuits</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Goal Development</strong></p>
<p>Thana's Goal to "Unite the Clans" might develop into "Unite the Clans Through Ancient Traditions" after discovering historical rituals that once bound the clans together. This development adds a specific method to her objective, creating new story opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-trait-development"><a class="header" href="#new-trait-development">New Trait Development</a></h3>
<p>In addition to enhancing existing traits, characters can develop entirely new traits that reflect significant changes or accomplishments:</p>
<h4 id="story-driven-traits"><a class="header" href="#story-driven-traits">Story-Driven Traits</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Emerge from major accomplishments</li>
<li>Reflect significant changes</li>
<li>Connect to setting evolution</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Story-Driven Trait</strong></p>
<p>After completing a dangerous spiritual quest into the forbidden mountains, Elara gains the new trait "Bearer of the Flame," representing her connection to an ancient power source. This new trait creates fresh narrative and mechanical opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="relationship-traits"><a class="header" href="#relationship-traits">Relationship Traits</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Develop from ongoing connections</li>
<li>Show group dynamics</li>
<li>Reflect political positions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Relationship Trait</strong></p>
<p>After successfully mediating disputes between three noble houses, Darian develops the trait "Voice of Three Houses," representing his unique position in the political landscape. This trait helps in diplomatic situations but creates complications when the houses have conflicting interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="achievement-traits"><a class="header" href="#achievement-traits">Achievement Traits</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Mark major accomplishments</li>
<li>Show expertise development</li>
<li>Indicate social recognition</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example: Achievement Trait</strong></p>
<p>After successfully navigating the city's underground network multiple times, Nessa develops the trait "Master of Hidden Ways," representing her exceptional knowledge of secret passages. This trait helps in stealth and navigation but creates expectations that she can always find a way through.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="implementing-trait-evolution"><a class="header" href="#implementing-trait-evolution">Implementing Trait Evolution</a></h3>
<p>When using these expanded trait options, consider these implementation guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrative First</strong>: Traits should evolve naturally from story events rather than being selected purely for mechanical advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Milestone Timing</strong>: New traits typically emerge at significant story milestones rather than on a fixed schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Group Involvement</strong>: Other characters should acknowledge and interact with new traits, creating relationship opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Integration</strong>: Trait evolution should connect to and potentially influence setting elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balance Consideration</strong>: New traits should create both advantages and complications, maintaining the core system's balance.</p>
</li>

<p>When considering optional rules, keep these principles in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrative Priority</strong>: Choose options that enhance rather than overshadow the collaborative storytelling experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Group Consensus</strong>: Adopt only rules that your entire group finds engaging and manageable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Appropriateness</strong>: Select options that complement your specific setting and its axes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gradual Implementation</strong>: Introduce new elements gradually rather than all at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Evaluation</strong>: Periodically assess whether optional rules are enhancing your experience and be willing to adjust or remove them if needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore example materials that demonstrate how both core and optional rules work in practice, providing concrete illustrations of the Narrono system in action.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together</a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapters, you've learned the core concepts of Narrono: how to create a setting using the Five Axes framework, how to develop characters with traits and assets, how to connect them through the Relationship Web, and how the detailed mechanics work together to create meaningful narrative moments. You've also explored the role of the Game Facilitator and optional rules to customize your experience. Now it's time to see how all these elements work together in practice.</p>
<p>This chapter provides concrete examples that demonstrate the Narrono system in action. You'll find sample characters that showcase different approaches to character creation, detailed examples of play that illustrate how the mechanics create compelling narrative moments, quick reference materials for easy access during gameplay, and character tools to help you track and manage your game elements. These resources are designed to bridge the gap between understanding the rules and applying them effectively at the table.</p>
<p>Remember that these examples are starting points rather than rigid templates. Use them as inspiration for your own unique characters, situations, and stories that emerge through collaborative play.</p>

<h3 id="character-creation-walkthrough"><a class="header" href="#character-creation-walkthrough">Character Creation Walkthrough</a></h3>
<p>The following walkthrough demonstrates the process of creating a character for the Shadow Court setting, showing how each decision connects to the setting's axes and builds a cohesive character concept.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-connect-to-the-setting"><a class="header" href="#step-1-connect-to-the-setting">Step 1: Connect to the Setting</a></h4>
<p>First, consider how your character relates to the Shadow Court setting's five axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Scale: Local</strong> - Character operates within Ravenshire city</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural Level: Hidden</strong> - Character has some connection to the supernatural secret</li>
<li><strong>Technology Level: Moderate</strong> - Character uses industrial-age technology</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure: Hierarchical</strong> - Character has a defined position in social hierarchy</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Type: Social</strong> - Character navigates social influence and relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>For our example, we'll create Dr. James Harlow, a respected physician who has begun noticing strange symptoms in patients from certain families.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-develop-traits"><a class="header" href="#step-2-develop-traits">Step 2: Develop Traits</a></h4>
<p>Next, create traits that connect to the setting and establish your character's approach:</p>
<p><strong>Origin: Respected Physician</strong>
You earned your medical credentials abroad before establishing a successful practice in Ravenshire, serving patients across social classes while maintaining professional standing.</p>
<p><em>When this helps</em>: Medical situations, social interactions with educated elites, accessing restricted areas for health reasons, being viewed as trustworthy.</p>
<p><em>When this complicates</em>: Situations requiring deception, when medical ethics conflict with goals, dealing with supernatural elements that defy medical understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Drive: Heal the Afflicted</strong>
You're motivated by a genuine desire to help those suffering from illness or injury, regardless of their social standing or ability to pay.</p>
<p><em>When this helps</em>: Treating patients, gaining trust, maintaining focus during crises, resisting corruption or bribery.</p>
<p><em>When this complicates</em>: When healing one person endangers others, balancing professional detachment with compassion, when medical needs conflict with other goals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal: Understand the Strange Illness</strong>
You aim to identify the cause of unusual symptoms appearing in patients from Old Family bloodlines, suspecting there's more than conventional medicine can explain.</p>
<p><em>When this helps</em>: Medical research, pattern recognition, gaining cooperation from affected families, justifying unusual investigations.</p>
<p><em>When this complicates</em>: When the truth threatens powerful interests, balancing patient confidentiality with public health, when findings challenge scientific understanding.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-create-assets"><a class="header" href="#step-3-create-assets">Step 3: Create Assets</a></h4>
<p>Now develop assets that support your character's approach and connect to the setting:</p>
<p><strong>Medical Practice (Social Asset)</strong>
Your established clinic in a respectable district, providing legitimate access to patients across social classes.</p>
<p><em>Fresh</em>: Grants professional credibility, steady income, and a base of operations with medical equipment.</p>
<p><em>Degraded</em>: Reputation questioned or facilities limited due to controversy or resource constraints.</p>
<p><em>Depleted</em>: Temporarily closed or abandoned due to external pressure or necessary concealment.</p>
<p><strong>Research Journal (Knowledge Asset)</strong>
Your detailed documentation of cases, symptoms, treatments, and observations, including notes on the unusual patterns you've begun to notice.</p>
<p><em>Fresh</em>: Provides comprehensive medical reference, reveals patterns, and supports diagnostic work.</p>
<p><em>Degraded</em>: Information becomes disorganized or partially compromised, making research more difficult.</p>
<p><em>Depleted</em>: Temporarily inaccessible due to theft, damage, or necessary concealment.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Kit (Physical Asset)</strong>
Your comprehensive collection of medical instruments, medications, and supplies for both routine care and emergency treatment.</p>
<p><em>Fresh</em>: Enables treatment of most conditions, diagnostic work, and sample collection.</p>
<p><em>Degraded</em>: Some supplies depleted or instruments damaged, limiting treatment options.</p>
<p><em>Depleted</em>: Most supplies exhausted or equipment broken, severely restricting medical capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-establish-relationships"><a class="header" href="#step-4-establish-relationships">Step 4: Establish Relationships</a></h4>
<p>Finally, create relationships that connect your character to the setting and other characters:</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Board: Professional Authority (Strong)</strong>
Your position on Ravenshire General Hospital's governing board, providing institutional influence and access.</p>
<p><em>Strong</em>: Respected voice in hospital matters, access to facilities and records, influence over policy.</p>
<p><em>Strained</em>: Position questioned, requiring political maneuvering to maintain influence.</p>
<p><em>Broken</em>: Temporarily removed from the board due to controversy or political pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Old Family Patients: Doctor-Patient Trust (Strong)</strong>
Your role as physician to several Old Family members who trust your discretion and care.</p>
<p><em>Strong</em>: Provides access to Old Family homes, confidential information, and social protection.</p>
<p><em>Strained</em>: Trust questioned, requiring reassurance or limiting what patients reveal.</p>
<p><em>Broken</em>: Patients temporarily seek other medical care due to breached trust or external pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Clara Hayes: Information Exchange (Strained)</strong>
A cautious relationship with a journalist investigating unusual patterns in Ravenshire, including some that overlap with your medical observations.</p>
<p><em>Strong</em>: Mutual information sharing with appropriate anonymity and professional boundaries.</p>
<p><em>Strained</em>: Communication becomes hesitant, with concerns about confidentiality or motives.</p>
<p><em>Broken</em>: Contact temporarily severed due to professional risk or conflicting agendas.</p>
<h4 id="step-5-finalize-character"><a class="header" href="#step-5-finalize-character">Step 5: Finalize Character</a></h4>
<p>Review your character for cohesion and connection to the setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traits connect to setting axes (medical profession in hierarchical society, investigating hidden supernatural elements)</li>
<li>Assets support character approach (social standing, medical knowledge, practical tools)</li>
<li>Relationships create story opportunities (connections to both Old Families and investigators)</li>
<li>Character has clear motivations and conflicts (healing drive vs. dangerous knowledge)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. James Harlow is now ready for play, with clear connections to the Shadow Court setting and built-in story hooks through his medical practice, unusual observations, and relationships spanning different social spheres.</p>

<h2 id="72-example-of-play"><a class="header" href="#72-example-of-play">7.2 Example of Play</a></h2>
<p>The following examples demonstrate how the Narrono system works in practice, showing how mechanics and narrative work together to create compelling story moments.</p>
<h3 id="basic-resolution-example"><a class="header" href="#basic-resolution-example">Basic Resolution Example</a></h3>
<p>This example shows a simple resolution using each of the three methods (Direct, Balanced, and Cautious), demonstrating how the same situation can be approached differently.</p>
<h4 id="situation"><a class="header" href="#situation">Situation</a></h4>
<p>Clara Hayes attempts to gain access to city records that might contain information about unusual incidents in Ravenshire's history. The records office is supervised by a clerk who strictly follows regulations about access.</p>
<h4 id="direct-method-example"><a class="header" href="#direct-method-example">Direct Method Example</a></h4>
<p><strong>Clara's Approach:</strong> Clara decides to leverage her Press Credentials asset and her Drive to Uncover Hidden Stories, directly asserting her journalistic authority and right to access public records.</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "The records clerk, a thin man with wire-rimmed glasses, looks up from his ledger as you approach. 'Records access requires proper authorization,' he states flatly. How do you approach him?"</p>
<p><strong>Clara:</strong> "I'll use my Press Credentials asset and my Drive to Uncover Hidden Stories. I'll confidently present my press badge and explain that I'm researching a feature article on Ravenshire's historical development for the Chronicle's upcoming special edition. I'll be direct about my authority as a journalist to access public records."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "You're using your Drive directly, so this will be a Direct method roll. Your Press Credentials asset is Fresh, so you can use it for support. Roll your three dice."</p>
<p><strong>Clara rolls:</strong> 2, 4, 6</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Using the Direct method, you take the highest die: 6. That's a Success! The clerk examines your credentials carefully, then nods with reluctant respect. 'The Chronicle, is it? Very well. The historical development records are in Section C. Please sign the access log.' He grants you access to the records, though you notice him making a note in a separate ledger. Your direct approach has worked, but someone will know you've been researching these records."</p>
<h4 id="balanced-method-example"><a class="header" href="#balanced-method-example">Balanced Method Example</a></h4>
<p><strong>Clara's Approach:</strong> Clara decides to balance her journalistic approach with some personal connection, using both her Press Credentials and her Origin as a Provincial Journalist to establish rapport with the clerk.</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "The records clerk, a thin man with wire-rimmed glasses, looks up from his ledger as you approach. 'Records access requires proper authorization,' he states flatly. How do you approach him?"</p>
<p><strong>Clara:</strong> "I'll use my Press Credentials asset but also try to connect with him personally. I'll mention that I'm relatively new to Ravenshire, having moved from a smaller town, and that I'm still learning how things work here. I'll be respectful of his procedures while gently asserting my right to access public information."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "You're balancing your professional approach with personal connection, so this will be a Balanced method roll. Your Press Credentials asset is Fresh, so you can use it for support. Roll your three dice."</p>
<p><strong>Clara rolls:</strong> 2, 4, 6</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Using the Balanced method, you take the middle die: 4. That's a Partial Success. The clerk softens slightly at your mention of being new to the city. 'I understand the adjustment period,' he says with a hint of sympathy. 'I can grant you access to Section C, but only for one hour, and some of the more sensitive records will remain restricted. Will that work for your needs?' You gain limited access to the records, enough to find some useful information, but you'll need to be very efficient with your limited time."</p>
<h4 id="cautious-method-example"><a class="header" href="#cautious-method-example">Cautious Method Example</a></h4>
<p><strong>Clara's Approach:</strong> Clara decides to downplay her journalistic intentions and instead emphasize her interest in local history, going against her usual direct investigative approach.</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "The records clerk, a thin man with wire-rimmed glasses, looks up from his ledger as you approach. 'Records access requires proper authorization,' he states flatly. How do you approach him?"</p>
<p><strong>Clara:</strong> "I'll hide my press credentials and approach this as a private citizen interested in local history. I'll mention that I'm researching my newly rented apartment's building history out of personal curiosity, and ask if he could help me access those specific records."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "You're deliberately going against your usual direct journalistic approach, so this will be a Cautious method roll. Since you're not using your Press Credentials asset, you won't get that support. Roll your three dice."</p>
<p><strong>Clara rolls:</strong> 2, 4, 6</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Using the Cautious method, you take the lowest die: 2. That's a Setback. The clerk narrows his eyes suspiciously. 'Personal research requires a different form, and there's a waiting period for processing requests from private citizens. If you're actually a journalist working on a story, you should declare that officially.' He seems unconvinced by your approach, and you won't gain access today. However, you overhear him mentioning to a colleague that they should 'check with Mr. Caldwell about the increased interest in historical records.' This name—Caldwell—is one of the Old Families you've been investigating, suggesting an unexpected connection between the records office and the family."</p>
<h3 id="complex-scene-example"><a class="header" href="#complex-scene-example">Complex Scene Example</a></h3>
<p>This example demonstrates a more complex scene involving multiple characters, asset usage, and relationship dynamics.</p>
<h4 id="situation-1"><a class="header" href="#situation-1">Situation</a></h4>
<p>Elena Blackthorn, Marcus Webb, and Clara Hayes find themselves at the same charity gala hosted by the mayor. Each has different goals: Elena wants to ensure supernatural elements remain hidden, Marcus is looking for evidence of corruption, and Clara is gathering information for her investigation.</p>
<h4 id="scene-setup"><a class="header" href="#scene-setup">Scene Setup</a></h4>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "The mayor's annual charity gala fills the grand ballroom of Ravenshire City Hall. Crystal chandeliers cast warm light over elegantly dressed guests from the city's elite circles. Servants weave through the crowd with champagne and hors d'oeuvres, while a string quartet plays softly in the corner. Mayor Winthrop himself stands near the main entrance, greeting important guests.</p>
<p>Elena, you immediately notice several Old Family members in attendance, including representatives from the Hargroves and Caldwells. Your uncle, the Blackthorn patriarch, gives you a meaningful nod from across the room.</p>
<p>Marcus, despite your formal attire, you feel several suspicious glances from security personnel. Your Reform Movement contacts informed you that documents regarding city fund allocation might be accessible in the mayor's office upstairs.</p>
<p>Clara, your press credentials got you in the door, but you're restricted to the main ballroom unless you can secure permission to interview specific officials. You recognize several subjects of your investigation, including both Elena Blackthorn and the hospital board president who works closely with Dr. Harlow."</p>
<h4 id="resolution-sequence"><a class="header" href="#resolution-sequence">Resolution Sequence</a></h4>
<p><strong>Elena's Action:</strong> "I'll use my Noble's Network asset to circulate through the party, ensuring that any supernatural elements remain controlled. I want to identify any potential threats to the Veil while maintaining my public persona as a respected councilwoman."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Roll using your preferred method."</p>
<p><strong>Elena rolls Direct:</strong> 3, 5, 6 = 6 (Success)</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "With a successful roll, you smoothly navigate the social currents of the gala. Your family connections grant you immediate respect, and you're able to steer conversations away from sensitive topics when needed. You notice something concerning—Clara Hayes, that persistent journalist, is speaking with Councilman Hargrove, who had too much champagne and is gesturing animatedly about 'family traditions.' You can intervene before he says too much."</p>
<p><strong>Elena:</strong> "I'll smoothly insert myself into their conversation and redirect it to the charity auction items."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "As you approach, you hear Hargrove saying '...been in the family for generations, unique abilities that—' before you gracefully interrupt. Clara gives you a measured look, clearly recognizing the intervention for what it is. This interaction puts some strain on your already complicated relationship with her."</p>
<p><strong>Marcus's Action:</strong> "While Elena is distracting Clara and the other guests, I want to slip away from the main ballroom and make my way toward the mayor's office upstairs. I'll use my Thief's Tools asset if needed."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "This will be challenging given the security. What method are you using?"</p>
<p><strong>Marcus rolls Cautious:</strong> 1, 3, 4 = 1 (Setback)</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "You attempt to casually make your way toward the staff entrance, but a security guard steps directly into your path. 'Sir, that area is restricted to authorized personnel only.' Your attempt to access the upper floors has failed, and the guard is now watching you with increased suspicion. However, you notice something interesting—the guard's sleeve pulls back slightly, revealing a tattoo that matches symbols you've seen in Reform Movement intelligence about the Keepers, agents who maintain the Veil. This security team may have connections to the supernatural elements you're investigating."</p>
<p><strong>Clara's Action:</strong> "I want to follow up on what Councilman Hargrove was saying before Elena interrupted. I'll use my Investigative Files asset to recall details about the Hargrove family that might help me ask subtle but probing questions."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "What method will you use?"</p>
<p><strong>Clara rolls Balanced:</strong> 2, 3, 5 = 3 (Partial Success)</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "You manage to separate Hargrove from Elena by mentioning an interest in his family's historical contribution to Ravenshire. He seems flattered by your interest and reveals that his family has 'always had a special connection to the emotional states of others,' before catching himself. He becomes more guarded, but you've gained a valuable clue about possible supernatural abilities. However, you notice Elena watching you carefully from across the room, and your relationship with her becomes further Strained as she recognizes your investigative tactics."</p>
<h4 id="relationship-evolution-1"><a class="header" href="#relationship-evolution-1">Relationship Evolution</a></h4>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Clara, your relationship with Elena Blackthorn was already cautious, but after this interaction, it shifts to Strained. Elena sees you as actively pursuing dangerous knowledge, while you perceive her as deliberately obstructing your investigation. This will affect future interactions between you."</p>
<p><strong>Clara:</strong> "I'll make a note of that on my character sheet. Does this affect my Anonymous Source relationship, since that might be connected to Elena?"</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Good question. Your Anonymous Source relationship remains Strong for now, but this increased tension with Elena might eventually impact it if she discovers the connection."</p>
<h4 id="asset-state-changes"><a class="header" href="#asset-state-changes">Asset State Changes</a></h4>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Marcus, your failed attempt to access the restricted area has drawn attention. Your Thief's Tools asset remains Fresh since you didn't get to use it, but your Reform Network asset becomes Degraded as security at the event begins taking photos of guests and you worry some of your contacts might be identified."</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> "I'll update my character sheet. Can I attempt to warn some of my contacts discreetly?"</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Yes, but that would require another roll and might draw more attention. Do you want to try?"</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> "I'll wait for a better opportunity. For now, I'll return to the main gala and try to gather information through conversation instead."</p>
<h3 id="full-session-breakdown"><a class="header" href="#full-session-breakdown">Full Session Breakdown</a></h3>
<p>The following breakdown demonstrates how a complete session might unfold, showing the flow between scenes, mechanical resolutions, and narrative development.</p>
<h4 id="session-setup"><a class="header" href="#session-setup">Session Setup</a></h4>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> Shadow Court (Ravenshire)
<strong>Characters:</strong> Elena Blackthorn, Marcus Webb, Clara Hayes, Dr. James Harlow
<strong>Situation:</strong> Strange shadows have been appearing throughout Ravenshire, potentially breaking the Veil that keeps supernatural elements hidden. The characters approach this developing situation from different angles.</p>
<h4 id="scene-1-the-hospital-consultation"><a class="header" href="#scene-1-the-hospital-consultation">Scene 1: The Hospital Consultation</a></h4>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Dr. Harlow, you've been called to consult on an unusual case at Ravenshire General. A patient has been admitted with symptoms that defy conventional diagnosis—shadow-like markings on their skin that seem to move when not directly observed. The patient is Thomas Caldwell, a member of one of the Old Families."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Harlow:</strong> "I'll examine the patient thoroughly, paying special attention to these moving shadows. I'll use my Medical Kit asset and my Goal to Understand the Strange Illness."</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Roll using your preferred method."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Harlow rolls Direct:</strong> 2, 3, 6 = 6 (Success)</p>
<p><strong>GF:</strong> "Your examination reveals something extraordinary. The shadows aren't just on the skin—they seem to be emerging from within the patient, as if his body is generating them. When you check his family history, you find references to similar symptoms in Caldwell ancestors, described as 'the family blessing' rather than an illness. This confirms your suspicion that some conditions in the Old Families have supernatural origins."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Harlow:</strong> "I'll document this carefully in my Research Journal asset, using medical terminology that wouldn't raise suspicions. I want to speak with the patient privately about his family history."</p>

<h2 id="2-connection-density-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#2-connection-density-guidelines">2. Connection Density Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>Determine the appropriate number and distribution of relationships:</p>
<h3 id="optimal-density"><a class="header" href="#optimal-density">Optimal Density</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Connections</strong>: Each character should have at least 2-3 meaningful relationships</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Connections</strong>: Avoid more than 5-7 connections per character</li>
<li><strong>Group Size Formula</strong>: For a group of N characters, aim for N to 2N total relationships</li>
<li><strong>Faction Connections</strong>: Each character should have 1-2 faction relationships</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connection-distribution"><a class="header" href="#connection-distribution">Connection Distribution</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even Distribution</strong>: Ensure all characters have similar numbers of connections</li>
<li><strong>Varied Types</strong>: Mix relationship types (family, professional, adversarial, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Varied States</strong>: Include relationships in different states (strong, strained, broken)</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Group Connections</strong>: Ensure no character is isolated from the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-appropriate-density"><a class="header" href="#setting-appropriate-density">Setting-Appropriate Density</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Scale Impact</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Personal: More intimate, fewer connections</li>
<li>Global: More extensive, complex networks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure Impact</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Tribal: Dense family/clan connections</li>
<li>Fluid: More diverse, changing connections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technology Level Impact</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Limited: Primarily local, direct connections</li>
<li>Advanced: More distant, mediated connections</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balance-considerations"><a class="header" href="#balance-considerations">Balance Considerations</a></h3>

<h4 id="1-setting-layer-1"><a class="header" href="#1-setting-layer-1">1. Setting Layer</a></h4>
<p>Establish the context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference relevant axis elements</li>
<li>Show setting constraints</li>
<li>Establish scene context</li>
<li>Present setting-specific details</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>"In this Merit-based, Advanced Tech setting, the corporate lobby's security scanners hum quietly. Your degraded Access Card flickers, struggling with the latest encryption update."</em></p>

## Session Pacing Guidelines
<h3 id="session-structure"><a class="header" href="#session-structure">Session Structure</a></h3>
<p>A well-paced session typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening Scene</strong>: Establish situation and immediate goals</li>
<li><strong>Rising Action</strong>: 2-3 scenes of increasing complexity</li>
<li><strong>Turning Point</strong>: A major decision or revelation</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Consequences and outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Denouement</strong>: Character moments and future hooks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scene-transitions"><a class="header" href="#scene-transitions">Scene Transitions</a></h3>
<p>Effective transitions between scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect to character decisions</li>
<li>Show passage of time</li>
<li>Change location or perspective</li>
<li>Introduce new elements</li>
<li>Escalate tension or provide contrast</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pacing-adjustments"><a class="header" href="#pacing-adjustments">Pacing Adjustments</a></h3>
<p>When to adjust pacing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed up</strong>: When energy is lagging, decisions stall, or focus wanders</li>
<li><strong>Slow down</strong>: During important character moments, major decisions, or emotional scenes</li>
<li><strong>Add complexity</strong>: When players are succeeding too easily</li>
<li><strong>Simplify</strong>: When players are overwhelmed or frustrated</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="quick-start-rules"><a class="header" href="#quick-start-rules">Quick Start Rules</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Narrono! This quick start guide provides the essential rules you need to jump into a pre-built adventure module. For the complete rules, refer to the full manual.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-game-is-this"><a class="header" href="#what-kind-of-game-is-this">What Kind of Game is This?</a></h2>
<p>Narrono is a collaborative storytelling game where you and your friends build a dramatic narrative together. Unlike games where you're simply following a predetermined story or overcoming challenges set by the Game Facilitator, in Narrono:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You actively shape the story</strong> through your choices both before and during play</li>
<li><strong>Your character's decisions have meaningful consequences</strong> that ripple throughout the narrative</li>
<li><strong>The story emerges organically</strong> from the interaction of characters, setting, and situations</li>
<li><strong>Everyone at the table contributes</strong> to creating a compelling, evolving narrative</li>
<li><strong>The rules exist to serve the story</strong>, providing structure and dramatic tension</li>
</ul>
<p>In Narrono, the choices you make during character creation—selecting traits, assets, and relationships—establish who your character is and how they connect to the world. Then, during play, every decision about which traits to emphasize, which assets to risk, and which relationships to leverage further shapes the unfolding story in ways that neither you nor the Game Facilitator could have predicted.</p>
<p>The result is a truly collaborative experience where the Game Facilitator may set the stage, but you and your fellow players determine what happens on it. Together, you'll create a unique story that couldn't exist without your specific contributions.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts-1"><a class="header" href="#core-concepts-1">Core Concepts</a></h2>
<p>With that understanding of what Narrono is about, here are the key mechanical concepts that support this collaborative storytelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters are defined by traits that connect them to the setting</li>
<li>Actions are resolved using the Pool System (3d6)</li>
<li>Assets and relationships can be used and risked for greater effect</li>
<li>Every choice creates rippling consequences throughout the story</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-pool-system-2"><a class="header" href="#the-pool-system-2">The Pool System</a></h2>
<h3 id="basic-resolution"><a class="header" href="#basic-resolution">Basic Resolution</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Roll three six-sided dice (3d6)</li>
<li>Choose which result to use based on your method</li>
<li>Apply any asset or relationship effects</li>
<li>Determine outcome level</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="resolution-methods-1"><a class="header" href="#resolution-methods-1">Resolution Methods</a></h3>
<h4 id="direct-method-1"><a class="header" href="#direct-method-1">Direct Method</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>highest</strong> die</li>
<li>For actions in clear alignment with a trait</li>
<li>Higher chance of success but also higher risk</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="balanced-method-1"><a class="header" href="#balanced-method-1">Balanced Method</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>middle</strong> die</li>
<li>For actions where no traits strongly apply</li>
<li>Most consistent results</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cautious-method-1"><a class="header" href="#cautious-method-1">Cautious Method</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>lowest</strong> die</li>
<li>For actions against trait tendencies</li>
<li>Lower chance of success but reduced risk</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-results"><a class="header" href="#understanding-results">Understanding Results</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success (5-6)</strong>: Achieve your intention, strengthen your position</li>
<li><strong>Partial Success (3-4)</strong>: Achieve intention with a cost or complication</li>
<li><strong>Setback (1-2)</strong>: Miss your intention, face a major complication</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="character-traits-2"><a class="header" href="#character-traits-2">Character Traits</a></h2>
<p>Characters have three core traits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin</strong>: Where you come from (shaped by Social Structure)</li>
<li><strong>Drive</strong>: What motivates you (shaped by Conflict Type)</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: What you're trying to achieve (shaped by Power Scale)</li>

<h3 id="assets-3"><a class="header" href="#assets-3">Assets</a></h3>
<p>Assets are equipment, abilities, or resources your character can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh</strong>: Providing full benefits</li>
<li><strong>Degraded</strong>: Creating complications but still usable</li>
<li><strong>Depleted</strong>: Temporarily unusable until restored</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relationships-3"><a class="header" href="#relationships-3">Relationships</a></h3>
<p>Relationships connect characters to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong</strong>: Full benefits and support</li>
<li><strong>Strained</strong>: Limited benefits with complications</li>
<li><strong>Broken</strong>: Temporarily unusable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-assets-and-relationships"><a class="header" href="#using-assets-and-relationships">Using Assets and Relationships</a></h3>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-shared-story-pool-2"><a class="header" href="#the-shared-story-pool-2">The Shared Story Pool</a></h2>
<p>At the start of each session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player adds one d6</li>
<li>GF adds two d6s</li>
</ul>
<p>Players can use dice from the pool to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add complexity to the story</li>
<li>Establish relationships</li>
<li>Create opportunities</li>
<li>Enhance rolls</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quick-play-guide"><a class="header" href="#quick-play-guide">Quick Play Guide</a></h2>

<p>Relationships are the connections between characters that provide both opportunities and complications. This guide explains how relationships work in Narrono and how to use them effectively in play.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-relationships"><a class="header" href="#understanding-relationships">Understanding Relationships</a></h2>
<p>Each relationship has three key components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Parties Involved</strong>: Who is connected (usually two characters, but can include groups)</li>
<li><strong>The Relationship Type</strong>: The nature of the connection (professional, personal, antagonistic, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>The Current State</strong>: How strong or strained the relationship is at present</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="relationship-types-3"><a class="header" href="#relationship-types-3">Relationship Types</a></h2>
<p>Relationships can take many forms, each with different implications:</p>
<h3 id="personal-relationships"><a class="header" href="#personal-relationships">Personal Relationships</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Family Ties: Connections through blood or adoption</li>
<li>Friendships: Voluntary bonds based on mutual affection</li>
<li>Romantic Connections: Intimate emotional attachments</li>
<li>Mentorships: Guidance and learning relationships</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="professional-relationships"><a class="header" href="#professional-relationships">Professional Relationships</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Authority Chains: Hierarchical connections (boss/employee, officer/subordinate)</li>
<li>Collegial Bonds: Peer relationships in work or organizations</li>
<li>Client Connections: Service provider and recipient relationships</li>
<li>Alliance Partnerships: Formal cooperation between equals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="antagonistic-relationships"><a class="header" href="#antagonistic-relationships">Antagonistic Relationships</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rivalries: Competition for the same goals or resources</li>
<li>Blackmail Bonds: Relationships based on mutual leverage</li>
<li>Vendettas: Ongoing conflicts driven by past wrongs</li>
<li>Hunter/Hunted: Pursuit relationships</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="community-relationships"><a class="header" href="#community-relationships">Community Relationships</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Group Memberships: Belonging to organizations or communities</li>
<li>Public Personas: Relationships with broader society</li>
<li>Factional Ties: Connections to political or social movements</li>
<li>Cultural Bonds: Shared heritage or background connections</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relationship-states-2"><a class="header" href="#relationship-states-2">Relationship States</a></h2>
<p>Like assets, relationships exist in different states that reflect their current condition:</p>
<h3 id="strong-1"><a class="header" href="#strong-1">Strong</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Providing full benefits and support</li>
<li>Reliable and trustworthy</li>
<li>Adds one die to your pool when leveraged</li>
<li>Creates opportunities for both parties</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Elena's Strong relationship with the City Council gives her reliable influence over policy decisions.</p>
<h3 id="strained-1"><a class="header" href="#strained-1">Strained</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited benefits with complications</li>
<li>Requires extra effort to maintain</li>
<li>No dice bonus when used</li>
<li>May create additional challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Marcus's Strained blackmail bond with Elena means both must tread carefully, with trust broken down and subtle threats exchanged.</p>
<h3 id="broken-1"><a class="header" href="#broken-1">Broken</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily unusable</li>
<li>Active hostility or complete disconnection</li>
<li>Provides no benefits and may create obstacles</li>
<li>Requires significant effort to repair</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: If Clara's relationship with her captain becomes Broken, she might face disciplinary action and lose access to police resources.</p>
<h3 id="transformed-1"><a class="header" href="#transformed-1">Transformed</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed into a different type of relationship</li>
<li>Fundamentally altered in nature</li>
<li>May be stronger or weaker than before</li>
<li>Creates new narrative possibilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: A professional mentorship might transform into a friendship, or a rivalry might transform into a reluctant alliance.</p>

<li>Is your action aligned with or against your trait tendencies?</li>
<li>How does the setting influence this action?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose your resolution method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Method</strong>: Use highest die when acting in alignment with a trait</li>
<li><strong>Balanced Method</strong>: Use middle die when no traits strongly apply</li>

</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Consider assets and relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a Fresh asset that could help?</li>
<li>Is there a Strong relationship you could leverage?</li>
<li>Are you willing to risk degrading an asset or straining a relationship?</li>

<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Ravenshire is a city steeped in history and secrets, where ancient noble families have ruled for centuries through a combination of political influence, wealth, and secretly wielded supernatural powers. The city presents a façade of normalcy to the world, but beneath this veneer lies a complex web of shadow magic, power struggles, and hidden agendas.</p>
<h2 id="geography"><a class="header" href="#geography">Geography</a></h2>
<p>Ravenshire sits at the convergence of two rivers, surrounded by mist-shrouded hills. The city is divided into several districts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Old Quarter</strong>: Ancient stone buildings where the oldest noble families reside</li>
<li><strong>Merchant District</strong>: The bustling commercial center of the city</li>
<li><strong>Riverside</strong>: Working-class neighborhoods along the river</li>
<li><strong>The Heights</strong>: Newer mansions and estates for wealthy families</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="history"><a class="header" href="#history">History</a></h2>

<p>In the rugged landscape that was once North America, now known as the Broken Lands, humanity has reorganized into clan-based societies following a global technological collapse.

<h2 id="key-setting-elements-1"><a class="header" href="#key-setting-elements-1">Key Setting Elements</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-collapse"><a class="header" href="#the-collapse">The Collapse</a></h3>
<p>Approximately three generations ago, a series of cascading technological failures led to the breakdown of global communication systems, power grids, and supply chains. The exact causes remain disputed—theories range from coordinated attacks to catastrophic technical failures to natural disasters—but the result was the fragmentation of large-scale society and a return to smaller, more self-sufficient communities.</p>
<h3 id="the-rememberers"><a class="header" href="#the-rememberers">The Rememberers</a></h3>
<p>Individuals who maintain the oral history of the time before the collapse and the early struggle years. Their histories vary by clan, but all serve the vital function of preserving knowledge and cautionary tales about the old world's hubris. In some clans, Rememberers hold formal authority; in others, they serve as advisors.</p>
<h3 id="the-reclamation"><a class="header" href="#the-reclamation">The Reclamation</a></h3>
<p>A generational project undertaken by most clans to recover useful technology and knowledge from abandoned urban centers. These expeditions are dangerous, as many old cities have become unstable or toxic, but the potential rewards in terms of tools, medicine, and information make the risk worthwhile.</p>
<h3 id="the-seasonal-gathering"><a class="header" href="#the-seasonal-gathering">The Seasonal Gathering</a></h3>
<p>A time of truce when clans convene at neutral sites to trade, share information, resolve disputes, arrange marriages, and strengthen ties. These gatherings follow the patterns of seasonal migration and serve as the primary means of inter-clan diplomacy and cultural exchange.</p>
<h3 id="the-council-of-elders"><a class="header" href="#the-council-of-elders">The Council of Elders</a></h3>
<p>Most clans are governed by a council of experienced members who have demonstrated wisdom and skill. The exact composition varies—some are hereditary, others meritocratic, some balanced by gender or skill set—but all serve as the decision-making body for major clan choices.</p>
<h2 id="locations-2"><a class="header" href="#locations-2">Locations</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-great-salt-basin"><a class="header" href="#the-great-salt-basin">The Great Salt Basin</a></h3>
<p>Once a thriving metropolitan region, now a partially flooded basin where the remnants of skyscrapers rise from brackish water. Rich in salvageable materials but dangerous due to unstable structures and territorial gangs who aren't affiliated with the recognized clans.</p>
<h3 id="the-heritage-farm-lands"><a class="header" href="#the-heritage-farm-lands">The Heritage Farm Lands</a></h3>
<p>Fertile territory where several clans have established permanent settlements based around sustainable agriculture. Competition for the best soils creates tension, but the area's productivity makes it too valuable for all-out warfare.</p>
<h3 id="the-mountain-passes"><a class="header" href="#the-mountain-passes">The Mountain Passes</a></h3>
<p>Vital trade routes through treacherous terrain, controlled by clans who specialize in navigation and transport. Knowledge of safe paths and seasons is closely guarded, and tolls are extracted in goods or favors rather than currency.</p>
<h3 id="the-ancient-dam"><a class="header" href="#the-ancient-dam">The Ancient Dam</a></h3>
<p>A massive hydroelectric facility that still functions at partial capacity, providing power to clans who maintain the knowledge to use it. Control of the dam shifts between alliances, with an unspoken agreement that destroying it would be unforgivable.</p>
<h3 id="the-trading-post"><a class="header" href="#the-trading-post">The Trading Post</a></h3>
<p>Originally a highway rest stop, now expanded into a neutral zone where clans can meet for commerce without fear of violence. Maintained by representatives from multiple clans, it operates under strict protocols that all visitors must observe.</p>
<h2 id="clans"><a class="header" href="#clans">Clans</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-watershed-clan"><a class="header" href="#the-watershed-clan">The Watershed Clan</a></h3>
<p>Masters of water management who control several key reservoirs and irrigation systems. Their knowledge of purification techniques and weather prediction makes them essential allies, though their strict water-sharing protocols can create friction with neighbors.</p>
<h3 id="the-circuit-clan"><a class="header" href="#the-circuit-clan">The Circuit Clan</a></h3>
<p>Specialists in electrical systems and electronic repair who maintain a repository of pre-collapse devices. They travel between settlements, trading their technical skills for food and other necessities, remaining politically neutral by necessity.</p>
<h3 id="the-roadwalkers"><a class="header" href="#the-roadwalkers">The Roadwalkers</a></h3>
<p>Nomadic scouts and messengers who maintain the most comprehensive mental maps of the region. They serve as communication links between stationary clans and are granted passage rights by most groups due to their useful intelligence on conditions elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="the-red-valley-clan"><a class="header" href="#the-red-valley-clan">The Red Valley Clan</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural specialists who control the largest contiguous farmland. Their prosperity has allowed them to grow significantly, creating internal social stratification that mirrors pre-collapse society more than the egalitarian structures of other clans.</p>
<h3 id="the-forge-clan"><a class="header" href="#the-forge-clan">The Forge Clan</a></h3>
<p>Metalworkers and manufacturers who have redeveloped complex crafting techniques. Their weapons and tools are the highest quality available, giving them significant leverage in negotiations despite their smaller numbers and limited territory.</p>
<h2 id="campaign-themes-1"><a class="header" href="#campaign-themes-1">Campaign Themes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tradition vs. Innovation</strong>: When should old ways be preserved, and when should new approaches be developed?</li>
<li><strong>Competition vs. Cooperation</strong>: How can clans balance their own needs against the benefits of working together?</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge as Power</strong>: Who controls information about the past, and how does this shape the future?</li>
<li><strong>Family vs. Community</strong>: Where do clan loyalties end and broader human connections begin?</li>
<li><strong>Scarcity vs. Sustainability</strong>: How do people balance immediate needs against long-term survival?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="story-hooks-1"><a class="header" href="#story-hooks-1">Story Hooks</a></h2>
